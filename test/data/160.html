Isaac Muse


facelessuser
 



              Colorado
            



I am an open source developer with a current focus on Python projects.
I am the author and maintainer of SoupSieve, the library behind BeautifulSoup's CSS selector support.
I am the author and maintainer of the popular PyMdown Extensions project, which extends Python Markdown (which I am also a contributor to) and adds many useful features. It is also heavily used by MkDocs Material (which I work closely with), an extremely popular MkDocs theme.
I also support other various Python PyPI projects, such as:

Rummage: a Python, cross platform, graphical search and replace tool.
wcmatch: an enhanced fnmatch/glob library for Python.
bracex: a brace expansion library for Python.
backrefs a wrapper around Python's regular expression library that adds useful back-references.
pyspelling a wrapper around aspell and/or hunspell and allows for automated spellchecking tasks in CI and advanced filtering.

I am also active in the Sublime Text community and am the author and maintainer of multiple popular plugins:

BracketHighlighter
ApplySytax
ExportHtml
and more
