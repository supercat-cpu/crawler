Going Ad-free

      Read the Docs has grown substantially
      since its beginning as a weekend project and is closing in on being a top-1000 site on the internet.
      Today, we:
    


Serve over 55 million pages of documentation a month
Serve over 40 TB of documentation a month
Host over 240,000 open source projects and support over 400,000 users
Are supported by a very small team of dedicated engineers


      We mainly fund our operations through advertising
      and corporate-hosted documentation with Read the Docs for Business,
      and we are supported by a number of generous sponsors.
      We have two ways to go ad-free:
    

If you would like to stop seeing ads when logged-in with your Read the Docs account,
        you can also support us with a one-time donation.
If you have an open source project you would like to make ad-free for all users,
        you need a recurring Gold membership.




Opting out of ads for your account



          Since its inception, Read the Docs has grown
          into a massive resource that developers rely on daily.
          Many individuals and companies have contributed financially
          to Read the Docs over the years.
        

          If you consider Read the Docs to be a useful service,
          and would like to see it continue to grow,
          consider pitching in to help cover the cost of bringing free and open documentation to everyone.
          Supporters receive an ad-free experience on Read the Docs when logged in.

Turn ads off for your project

Gold members support Read the Docs on a monthly basis and lets us work more on features that people love. All money goes directly to maintenance and development of Read the Docs.
    

    Like all supporters, being a Gold member makes Read the Docs ad-free when you are logged-in. In addition, Gold members may also completely remove advertising for all visitors to their projects.
    

For small businesses or personal projects, we ask for $5 per month to remove ads from a project.
For corporate supported open source projects, we ask for a $50 membership in order to cover our support and operations costs.


Becoming a Gold member with your existing Read the Docs account is a quick and easy way to support the continued development of Read the Docs.
