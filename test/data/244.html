README.rst




Warehouse
Warehouse is the software that powers PyPI.
See our development roadmap, documentation, and
architectural overview.

Getting Started
You can run Warehouse locally in a development environment using
docker and docker-compose. See Getting started
documentation for instructions on how to set it up.
The canonical deployment of Warehouse is in production at pypi.org.

Discussion
You can find help or get involved on:

Github issue tracker for reporting issues
IRC: on Libera, channel #pypa for general packaging discussion
and user support, and #pypa-dev for
discussions about development of packaging tools
The PyPA Discord for live discussions
The Packaging category on Discourse for discussing
new ideas and community initiatives


Testing
Read the running tests and linters section of our documentation to
learn how to test your code.  For cross-browser testing, we use an
open source account from BrowserStack. If your pull request makes
any change to the user interface, it will need to be tested to confirm
it works in our supported browsers.


Code of Conduct
Everyone interacting in the Warehouse project's codebases, issue trackers, chat
rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the PSF Code of Conduct.
