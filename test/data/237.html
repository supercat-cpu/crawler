» lxml takes all the pain out of XML. «
Stephan Richter


lxml is the most feature-rich
and easy-to-use library
for working with XML and HTML
in the Python language.


Introduction
lxml is a Pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It is
unique in that it combines the speed and feature completeness of these
libraries with the simplicity of a native Python API, mostly compatible but
superior to the well-known ElementTree API.  See the introduction for more
information about background and goals.  Some common questions are answered in
the FAQ.
This page describes the current stable version of lxml.  See also the
    web page of the development
    version.

Documentation
The complete lxml documentation is available for download as PDF
documentation. The HTML documentation from this web site is part of
the normal source download.

lxml.etree follows the ElementTree API as much as possible, building it on
top of the native libxml2 tree.  If you are new to ElementTree, start with the
lxml.etree Tutorial.  See also the ElementTree compatibility overview and
the benchmark results comparing lxml to the original ElementTree and
cElementTree implementations.
Right after the lxml.etree Tutorial and the ElementTree documentation, the
most important place to look is the lxml.etree specific API documentation.
It describes how lxml extends the ElementTree API to expose libxml2 and
libxslt specific functionality, such as XPath, Relax NG, XML Schema,
XSLT, and c14n.  Python code can be called from XPath expressions and
XSLT stylesheets through the use of extension functions.  lxml also offers
a SAX compliant API, that works with the SAX support in the standard
library.
There is a separate module lxml.objectify that implements a data-binding
API on top of lxml.etree.  See the objectify and etree FAQ entry for a
comparison.
In addition to the ElementTree API, lxml also features a sophisticated API for
custom element classes.  This is a simple way to write arbitrary XML driven
APIs on top of lxml.  As of version 1.1, lxml.etree has a new C-level API
that can be used to efficiently extend lxml.etree in external C modules,
including custom element class support.


Download
The best way to download lxml is to visit lxml at the Python Package
Index (PyPI).  It has the source that compiles on various platforms.
The source distribution is signed with this key.  Binary builds for
MS Windows usually become available through PyPI a few days after a
source release.  If you can't wait, consider trying a less recent
release version first.
The latest version is lxml 2.0.11, released 2008-12-12
(changes for 2.0.11).  Older versions are listed below.
Please take a look at the installation instructions!
This complete web site (including the generated API documentation) is
part of the source distribution, so if you want to download the
documentation for offline use, take the source archive and copy the
doc/html directory out of the source tree.
It's also possible to check out the latest development version of lxml
from svn directly, using a command like this:

svn co https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tree/master/trunk lxml

You can also browse the Subversion repository through the web, or
take a look at the Subversion history.  Please read how to build lxml
from source first.  The latest CHANGES of the developer version
are also accessible.  You can check there if a bug you found has been
fixed or a feature you want has been implemented in the latest trunk
version.


Mailing list
Questions? Suggestions? Code to contribute? We have a mailing list.
You can search the archive with Gmane or Google.


Bug tracker
lxml uses the launchpad bug tracker.  If you are sure you found a bug in
lxml, please file a bug report there.  If you are not sure whether some
unexpected behaviour of lxml is a bug or not, please ask on the mailing
list first.  Do not forget to search the archive (e.g. with Gmane)!


License
The lxml library is shipped under a BSD license. libxml2 and libxslt2
itself are shipped under the MIT license. There should therefore be no
obstacle to using lxml in your codebase.
