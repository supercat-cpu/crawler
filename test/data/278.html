PEP 8: Change requirement to adhere to Standard English (#1470)

    …
 

Instead of requiring that comments be written in Strunk & White Standard English, require instead that English-language comments be clear and easily understandable by other English speakers. This accomplishes the same goal without upholding relics of white supremacy. Many native English speakers do not use Standard English as their native dialect, so requiring conformation to Standard English centers whiteness in an inappropriate and unnecessary way, and can alienate and put up barriers for people of color and those whose native dialect of English is not Standard English. This change is a simple way to correct that while maintaining the original intent of the requirement.

PEP 0008: Clarify self-contradictory =-spacing rules (#820)

    …
 

Previously, the PEP contained roughly the following three rules, in sequence:

1. Never use spaces around `=` when used to indicate a parameter default
2. Something unrelated
3. DO use spaces around `=` when used to indicate a parameter default if there is also a parameter annotation present

This commit attempts to clarify this part of the PEP by:
* Combining the first and third rules listed above into a single rule that addresses both annotated and unannotated parameters
* Rephrasing the first rule to indicate that it applies only to unannotated parameters, to eliminate the logical contradiction

Update pep-0008.txt (#438)

    …
 

* Update pep-0008.txt

Clarified contradictions regarding comment formatting. NB Complete sentences should have a period.

* Update pep-0008.txt

Changed to remove reference to short comments without terminating period.

* Update pep-0008.txt

Further refined, corrected incorrect, fixed  singular/plural.

* Update pep-0008.txt

* Update pep-0008.txt

Edit for consistency use 'multi-' in 'multi-line` 'multi-statement` 'multi-sentence` etc with dash rather than space or no splitter (eg 'multi line`, 'multiline`). If a different convention is preferred, do that.

* Update pep-0008.txt 'latin' capitalization

'Latin' is a proper noun, and thus should be capitalized.

* Update pep-0008.txt 'boolean' capitalization

Capitalization should be consisted. I propose 'boolean' should always be capitalized, as per https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/4481/should-the-word-boolean-be-capitalized

At present it is inconsistently capitalised.
Changed 'boolean' to 'Boolean'

* Update pep-0008.txt - 'unicode' capitalization

Update pep-0008.txt - as a proper noun, 'unicode' should be capitalized. Fixed 3 instances.

* Revise Update pep-0008.txt

Removed revisions to 'boolean', 'unicode'. 

Unicode capitalization [issue](https://bugs.python.org/issue31873) under discussion.

* Removed trailing newlines

Removed trailing newlines

* Standardised 'multiline', reworded 'Latin'

Made the form 'multiline' uniform throughout the document. 

Clarified references to Latin alphabet to direct to the specific character set desired.

* Removed errant period

* Moved  'alphabet'

Moved  'alphabet' before encoding parenthesis line 336.

Cross-reference PEP 3131 from PEP 8 (#286)

PEP 3131 (Unicode identifiers) includes a policy section
covering their use within the standard library.

This adds an explicit cross-reference to that section from
the prescriptive naming conventions section of PEP 8.
