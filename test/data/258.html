        Attribute commits with collaborators easily
      

        Quickly add co-authors to your commit. Great for pairing and excellent for
        sending a little love/credit to that special someone who helped fix that
        gnarly bug of yours. See the attribution on the history page, undo an
        accidental attribution, and
        
          see the co-authors on github.com
        









        Checkout branches with pull requests and view CI statuses
      

        See all open pull requests for your repositories and check them out as if they were a local branch, even if
        they're from upstream branches or forks.
        See which pull requests pass commit status checks, too!
      








        Syntax highlighted diffs
      

        The new GitHub Desktop supports syntax highlighting when viewing diffs for a variety of different languages.
      













          Expanded image diff support
        

          Easily compare changed images. See the before and after, swipe or fade between the two,
          or look at just the changed parts.
        










          Extensive editor & shell integrations
        

          Open your favorite editor or shell from the app, or jump back to GitHub Desktop from your shell.
          GitHub Desktop is your springboard for work.
