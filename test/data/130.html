 Edit on GitHub







Read the Docs: Documentation SimplifiedÂ¶
Read the Docs simplifies software documentation
by building, versioning, and hosting of your docs, automatically.
This enables many âdocs like codeâ workflows,
keeping your code & documentation as close as possible.

Never out of sync ðWhenever you push code to your favorite version control system,
whether that is Git or Mercurial,
Read the Docs will automatically build your docs
so your code and documentation are always up-to-date.
Read more about VCS Integrations.

Multiple versions ðï¸Read the Docs can host and build multiple versions of your docs
so having a 1.0 version of your docs and a 2.0 version
of your docs is as easy as having a separate branch or tag in your version control system.
Read more about Versioned Documentation.

Open Source and User Focused ðOur code is free and open source.
Our company is bootstrapped and 100% user focused.
Read the Docs Community hosts documentation for over 100,000 large
and small open source projects,
in almost every human and computer language.
Read the Docs for Business supports hundreds of organizations with product and internal documentation.
