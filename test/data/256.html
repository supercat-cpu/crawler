Hi, I'm Stefan!
I maintain and enhance the Cython compiler for Python, the lxml XML toolkit, some features in CPython (including performance topics, C-API evolution, and the XML support in the standard library), and generally help to make Python a great language for all your processing needs. :)
You can help me with your sponsorship to build Better Software for You!
Repositories that I maintain, which will benefit from your donations:

The Cython compiler for Python
The lxml XML toolkit
quicktions – Fast Fractions for Python
Lupa – Lua in Python
others





      34 sponsors
      have funded
      scoder’s work.
  






        @scoder's goal is to
        
          have 1024 sponsors
        



          This would allow me to renovate the house that I live in and turn it into an energy and CO₂ efficient home.
