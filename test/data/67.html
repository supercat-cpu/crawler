The MoinMoin Wiki Engine

Overview
MoinMoin is an advanced, easy to use and extensible WikiEngine with a large community of users. Said in a few words, it is about collaboration on easily editable web pages. MoinMoin is Free Software licensed under the GPL - living from lots of people contributing (see MoinMoinAcknowledgements). If you want to learn more about wiki in general, first read about WikiWikiWeb, then about WhyWikiWorks and the WikiNature. If you want to play with it, please use the WikiSandBox. MoinMoinFeatures documents why you really want to use MoinMoin rather than another wiki engine. MoinMoinScreenShots shows how it looks like. You can also browse this wiki or visit some other MoinMoinWikis. 
Download
MoinMoinDownload contains hints and links to download the software. MoinMoinExtensions has an overview over available extensions and patches. 
Support
Documentation - please read it!  Support - lists the free (and also the paid) support options. Donations - if you like to support us. SecurityFixes - stay up to date regarding fixed security issues (also has details about how to report security issues) MoinBounties is the right place if you want to see some feature in MoinMoin and support the team with funding. 
Development
MoinMoinBugs is our bug tracker - look for known bugs or report new. FeatureRequests - post requests for new features there, add a patch if you can. WeNeedHelp documents areas where you can help us. MoinMoin2.0 - what moin2 will be about, developers wanted. RoadMap - about current and future development of moin 
Anti-Spam Measures in this wiki
As we have had major spam issues here in the past, the wiki now implements the following new antispam measures: New user accounts can only be created by superusers. If you need a new account for this wiki, ask ThomasWaldmann by e-mail. Send the e-mail from the e-mail address that will also be in your future wiki user profile and give the desired username. No write permissions any more for "Known" and "All" ACL groups, you need to be a member of TrustedEditorGroup to create or modify content. You can ask any current member to have your wiki user name added to the group. This is the default behaviour in moin 1.9.10+ releases. I switched off the TextChas (text captchas), guess they are not needed any more here. -- ThomasWaldmann 2018-08-20 21:08:13
