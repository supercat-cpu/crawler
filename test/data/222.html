Xcode 14
Xcode 14 includes everything you need to develop, test, and distribute apps across all Apple platforms. Leverage the simplicity and power of Swift and SwiftUI with a new multiplatform app experience, code faster with enhanced editor features, and start testing and deploying from Xcode Cloud to TestFlight and the App Store. Creating amazing apps has never been easier.















Lighter. Faster.
Xcode 14 lets you get started faster than ever with a binary that’s 30% smaller than before. Now with downloadable simulator runtimes for watchOS and tvOS, Xcode makes the latest platforms available as you need them.
Projects build up to 25% faster thanks to improved parallelism in all build and link phases.
And the new Build Timeline helps identify unexpectedly long-running build tasks and bottlenecks in your build.














Designed for multiplatform
The new multiplatform target creates a single SwiftUI interface for use across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS. Your code is easier to maintain, and ready to be customized to take advantage of each platform’s unique capabilities.
With the redesigned App Icon experience in Asset Catalogs, you can provide a single icon size for all platforms and Xcode will generate all the rest.














Productive coding
Be more productive than ever with many language and editing improvements. Smarter code completion and additional dynamic snippets will get you the code you want more quickly. While you scroll, code structure (like function declarations) stays visible so you always know where you are. And regular expressions in Swift are integrated with syntax highlighting, refactoring operations, and more.














Swift, SwiftUI, Swift Package
Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode 14 work together as one. SwiftUI previews are immediately interactive, and UI variations, such as light and dark appearances, are just a click away. The new template for Instruments makes it easy to debug and optimize usage of distributed actors and other Swift concurrency features. And with build and command package plug-ins, you can customize Xcode and your build process like never before.

Xcode Cloud
Xcode Cloud is now available for all Apple Developer Program members. Xcode Cloud is a continuous integration and delivery service built into Xcode and designed expressly for Apple developers. Start building your app in just a few minutes, monitor build status and reports, and distribute automatically to your testers and users. The Feedback organizer helps you review metrics, crashes, and user feedback, and now includes screenshots.
