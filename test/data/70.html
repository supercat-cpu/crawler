Software Calculated to Drive You Mad
We at Crummy want to help the developer community. Why? So that we
can gain their trust and then trick them into using our proprietary
technology.
Just kidding. The programs here are all licensed under either an
OSI-approved license or the generic 'look at the code and let me know
if you want to use it for something' license. Enjoy!
For many small but fun scripts, see Features.
