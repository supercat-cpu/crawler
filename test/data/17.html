This section only describes the rules for resources labeled with an HTML
  MIME type. Rules for XML resources are discussed in the section below entitled "The
  XML syntax".
13.1 Writing HTML documents
This section only applies to documents, authoring tools, and markup generators. In
  particular, it does not apply to conformance checkers; conformance checkers must use the
  requirements given in the next section ("parsing HTML documents").
Documents must consist of the following parts, in the given
  order:
Optionally, a single U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK (BOM) character.Any number of comments and ASCII
   whitespace.A DOCTYPE.

   Any number of comments and ASCII
   whitespace.The document element, in the form of an html element.Any number of comments and ASCII
   whitespace.
The various types of content mentioned above are described in the next few sections.
In addition, there are some restrictions on how character encoding declarations are to be serialized, as discussed in the
  section on that topic.

ASCII whitespace before the html element, at the start of the
   html element and before the head element, will be dropped when the
   document is parsed; ASCII whitespace after the html element
   will be parsed as if it were at the end of the body element. Thus, ASCII
   whitespace around the document element does not round-trip.
It is suggested that newlines be inserted after the DOCTYPE, after any comments that are
   before the document element, after the html element's start tag (if it is not omitted), and after any comments that are inside the
   html element but before the head element.

Many strings in the HTML syntax (e.g. the names of elements and their attributes) are
  case-insensitive, but only for ASCII upper alphas and
  ASCII lower alphas. For convenience, in this section this
  is just referred to as "case-insensitive".
13.1.1 The DOCTYPE
A DOCTYPE is a 
  required preamble.
DOCTYPEs are required for legacy reasons. When omitted, browsers tend to use a
  different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications. Including the DOCTYPE in a
  document ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant
  specifications.
A DOCTYPE must consist of the following components, in this order:
A string that is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string "<!DOCTYPE".One or more ASCII whitespace.A string that is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string "html".Optionally, a DOCTYPE legacy string.Zero or more ASCII whitespace.A U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN character (>).
In other words, <!DOCTYPE html>, case-insensitively.

For the purposes of HTML generators that cannot output HTML markup with the short DOCTYPE
  "<!DOCTYPE html>", a DOCTYPE legacy string may be inserted
  into the DOCTYPE (in the position defined above). This string must consist of:
One or more ASCII whitespace.A string that is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string "SYSTEM".One or more ASCII whitespace.A U+0022 QUOTATION MARK or U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (the quote mark).The literal string "about:legacy-compat".A matching U+0022 QUOTATION MARK or U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (i.e. the same character as in the earlier step labeled quote mark).
In other words, <!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "about:legacy-compat"> or
  <!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM 'about:legacy-compat'>, case-insensitively except for the
  part in single or double quotes.
The DOCTYPE legacy string should not be used unless the document is generated from
  a system that cannot output the shorter string.
13.1.2 Elements
There are six different kinds of elements: void
  elements, the template element, raw text
  elements, escapable raw text elements, foreign elements, and
  normal elements.
Void elementsarea, base, br, col, embed,
   hr, img, input, link, meta,
   source, track, wbrThe template elementtemplateRaw text elementsscript, styleEscapable raw text elementstextarea, titleForeign elementsElements from the MathML namespace and the SVG namespace.Normal elementsAll other allowed HTML elements are normal elements.
Tags are used to delimit the start and end of elements in the
  markup. Raw text, escapable raw text, and normal elements have
  a start tag to indicate where they begin, and an end tag to indicate where they end. The start and end tags of
  certain normal elements can be omitted, as
  described below in the section on optional tags. Those
  that cannot be omitted must not be omitted. Void elements only have a start tag; end
  tags must not be specified for void elements. Foreign elements must
  either have a start tag and an end tag, or a start tag that is marked as self-closing, in which
  case they must not have an end tag.
The contents of the element must be placed between
  just after the start tag (which might be implied, in certain
  cases) and just before the end tag (which again, might be
  implied in certain cases). The exact allowed contents of each individual element depend on
  the content model of that element, as described earlier in
  this specification. Elements must not contain content that their content model disallows. In
  addition to the restrictions placed on the contents by those content models, however, the five
  types of elements have additional syntactic requirements.
Void elements can't have any contents (since there's no end tag, no content can be
  put between the start tag and the end tag).
The template element can have
  template contents, but such template contents are not children of the
  template element itself. Instead, they are stored in a DocumentFragment
  associated with a different Document — without a browsing context — so
  as to avoid the template contents interfering with the main Document.
  The markup for the template contents of a template element is placed
  just after the template element's start tag and just before template
  element's end tag (as with other elements), and may consist of any text, character references, elements, and comments, but
  the text must not contain the character U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (<) or an ambiguous ampersand.
Raw text elements can have text, though it has restrictions described below.
Escapable raw text elements can have text and
  character references, but the text must not contain an ambiguous ampersand. There are also further restrictions described below.
Foreign elements whose start tag is marked as self-closing can't have any contents
  (since, again, as there's no end tag, no content can be put between the start tag and the end
  tag). Foreign elements whose start tag is not marked as self-closing can
  have text, character
  references, CDATA sections, other elements, and comments, but
  the text must not contain the character U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (<) or an ambiguous ampersand.

The HTML syntax does not support namespace declarations, even in foreign
   elements.
For instance, consider the following HTML fragment:
<p>
 <svg>
  <metadata>
   <!-- this is invalid -->
   <cdr:license xmlns:cdr="https://www.example.com/cdr/metadata" name="MIT"/>
  </metadata>
 </svg>
</p>
The innermost element, cdr:license, is actually in the SVG namespace, as
   the "xmlns:cdr" attribute has no effect (unlike in XML). In fact, as the
   comment in the fragment above says, the fragment is actually non-conforming. This is because
   SVG 2 does not define any elements called "cdr:license" in
   the SVG namespace.

Normal elements can have text, character references, other elements, and comments, but
  the text must not contain the character U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (<) or an ambiguous ampersand. Some normal elements
  also have yet more restrictions on what content they are
  allowed to hold, beyond the restrictions imposed by the content model and those described in this
  paragraph. Those restrictions are described below.
Tags contain a tag name, giving the element's name. HTML
  elements all have names that only use ASCII
  alphanumerics. In the HTML syntax, tag names, even those for foreign elements,
  may be written with any mix of lower- and uppercase letters that, when converted to all-lowercase,
  matches the element's tag name; tag names are case-insensitive.
13.1.2.1 Start tags
Start tags must have the following format:
The first character of a start tag must be a U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN character (<).The next few characters of a start tag must be the element's tag name.If there are to be any attributes in the next step, there must first be one or more
   ASCII whitespace.Then, the start tag may have a number of attributes, the syntax for which is described below. Attributes must be
   separated from each other by one or more ASCII whitespace.After the attributes, or after the tag name if there
   are no attributes, there may be one or more ASCII whitespace. (Some attributes are
   required to be followed by a space. See the attributes
   section below.)Then, if the element is one of the void elements, or if the element is a foreign element, then there may be a single U+002F SOLIDUS
   character (/). This character has no effect on void elements, but on foreign
   elements it marks the start tag as self-closing.Finally, start tags must be closed by a U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN character (>).
13.1.2.2 End tags
End tags must have the following format:
The first character of an end tag must be a U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN character (<).The second character of an end tag must be a U+002F SOLIDUS character (/).The next few characters of an end tag must be the element's tag
   name.After the tag name, there may be one or more ASCII whitespace.Finally, end tags must be closed by a U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN character (>).
13.1.2.3 Attributes
Attributes for an element are expressed inside the
  element's start tag.
Attributes have a name and a value. Attribute names
  must consist of one or more characters other than controls,
  U+0020 SPACE, U+0022 ("), U+0027 ('), U+003E (>), U+002F (/), U+003D (=), and noncharacters. In the HTML syntax, attribute names, even those for
  foreign elements, may be written with any mix of ASCII lower and ASCII upper alphas.
Attribute values are a mixture of text and character references,
  except with the additional restriction that the text cannot contain an ambiguous ampersand.
Attributes can be specified in four different ways:
Empty attribute syntax
Just the attribute name. The value is implicitly
    the empty string.

In the following example, the disabled attribute is
     given with the empty attribute syntax:
<input disabled>

If an attribute using the empty attribute syntax is to be followed by another attribute, then
    there must be ASCII whitespace separating the two.
Unquoted attribute value syntax
The attribute name, followed by zero or more
    ASCII whitespace, followed by a single U+003D EQUALS SIGN character, followed by
    zero or more ASCII whitespace, followed by the attribute value, which, in addition to the requirements
    given above for attribute values, must not contain any literal ASCII whitespace,
    any U+0022 QUOTATION MARK characters ("), U+0027 APOSTROPHE characters ('), U+003D
    EQUALS SIGN characters (=), U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN characters (<), U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN
    characters (>), or U+0060 GRAVE ACCENT characters (`), and must not be the empty string.

In the following example, the value attribute is given
     with the unquoted attribute value syntax:
<input value=yes>

If an attribute using the unquoted attribute syntax is to be followed by another attribute or
    by the optional U+002F SOLIDUS character (/) allowed in step 6 of the start tag syntax above, then there must be ASCII
    whitespace separating the two.
Single-quoted attribute value syntax
The attribute name, followed by zero or more
    ASCII whitespace, followed by a single U+003D EQUALS SIGN character, followed by
    zero or more ASCII whitespace, followed by a single U+0027 APOSTROPHE character
    ('), followed by the attribute value, which, in
    addition to the requirements given above for attribute values, must not contain any literal
    U+0027 APOSTROPHE characters ('), and finally followed by a second single U+0027 APOSTROPHE
    character (').

In the following example, the type attribute is given
     with the single-quoted attribute value syntax:
<input type='checkbox'>

If an attribute using the single-quoted attribute syntax is to be followed by another
    attribute, then there must be ASCII whitespace separating the two.
Double-quoted attribute value syntax
The attribute name, followed by zero or more
    ASCII whitespace, followed by a single U+003D EQUALS SIGN character, followed by
    zero or more ASCII whitespace, followed by a single U+0022 QUOTATION MARK character
    ("), followed by the attribute value, which, in
    addition to the requirements given above for attribute values, must not contain any literal
    U+0022 QUOTATION MARK characters ("), and finally followed by a second single U+0022 QUOTATION
    MARK character (").

In the following example, the name attribute is given with
     the double-quoted attribute value syntax:
<input name="be evil">

If an attribute using the double-quoted attribute syntax is to be followed by another
    attribute, then there must be ASCII whitespace separating the two.

There must never be two or more attributes on the same start tag whose names are an ASCII
  case-insensitive match for each other.

When a foreign element has one of the namespaced
  attributes given by the local name and namespace of the first and second cells of a row from the
  following table, it must be written using the name given by the third cell from the same row.
 Local name  Namespace  Attribute name
    actuate  XLink namespace  xlink:actuate
 arcrole  XLink namespace  xlink:arcrole
 href  XLink namespace  xlink:href
 role  XLink namespace  xlink:role
 show  XLink namespace  xlink:show
 title  XLink namespace  xlink:title
 type  XLink namespace  xlink:type
 lang  XML namespace  xml:lang
 space  XML namespace  xml:space
 xmlns  XMLNS namespace  xmlns
 xlink  XMLNS namespace  xmlns:xlink

No other namespaced attribute can be expressed in the HTML syntax.
Whether the attributes in the table above are conforming or not is defined by
  other specifications (e.g. SVG 2 and MathML); this section only
  describes the syntax rules if the attributes are serialized using the HTML syntax.
13.1.2.4 Optional tags
Certain tags can be omitted.
Omitting an element's start tag in the
  situations described below does not mean the element is not present; it is implied, but it is
  still there. For example, an HTML document always has a root html element, even if
  the string <html> doesn't appear anywhere in the markup.
An html element's start tag may be omitted
  if the first thing inside the html element is not a comment.

For example, in the following case it's ok to remove the "<html>"
   tag:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
  </body>
</html>
Doing so would make the document look like this:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>

  <head>
    <title>Hello</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
  </body>
</html>
This has the exact same DOM. In particular, note that whitespace around the document
   element is ignored by the parser. The following example would also have the exact same
   DOM:
<!DOCTYPE HTML><head>
    <title>Hello</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
  </body>
</html>
However, in the following example, removing the start tag moves the comment to before the
   html element:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <!-- where is this comment in the DOM? -->
  <head>
    <title>Hello</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
  </body>
</html>
With the tag removed, the document actually turns into the same as this:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<!-- where is this comment in the DOM? -->
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
  </body>
</html>
This is why the tag can only be removed if it is not followed by a comment: removing the tag
   when there is a comment there changes the document's resulting parse tree. Of course, if the
   position of the comment does not matter, then the tag can be omitted, as if the comment had been
   moved to before the start tag in the first place.

An html element's end tag may be omitted if
  the html element is not immediately followed by a comment.
A head element's start tag may be omitted if
  the element is empty, or if the first thing inside the head element is an
  element.
A head element's end tag may be omitted if
  the head element is not immediately followed by ASCII whitespace or a
  comment.
A body element's start tag may be omitted
  if the element is empty, or if the first thing inside the body element is not
  ASCII whitespace or a comment, except if the
  first thing inside the body element is a meta, noscript,
  link, script, style, or template element.
  
A body element's end tag may be omitted if the
  body element is not immediately followed by a comment.

Note that in the example above, the head element start and end tags, and the
   body element start tag, can't be omitted, because they are surrounded by
   whitespace:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
  </body>
</html>
(The body and html element end tags could be omitted without
   trouble; any spaces after those get parsed into the body element anyway.)
Usually, however, whitespace isn't an issue. If we first remove the whitespace we don't care
   about:
<!DOCTYPE HTML><html><head><title>Hello</title></head><body><p>Welcome to this example.</p></body></html>
Then we can omit a number of tags without affecting the DOM:
<!DOCTYPE HTML><title>Hello</title><p>Welcome to this example.</p>
At that point, we can also add some whitespace back:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<title>Hello</title>
<p>Welcome to this example.</p>
This would be equivalent to this document, with the omitted tags shown in their
   parser-implied positions; the only whitespace text node that results from this is the newline at
   the end of the head element:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html><head><title>Hello</title>
</head><body><p>Welcome to this example.</p></body></html>

An li element's end tag may be omitted if the
  li element is immediately followed by another li element or if there is
  no more content in the parent element.
A dt element's end tag may be omitted if the
  dt element is immediately followed by another dt element or a
  dd element.
A dd element's end tag may be omitted if the
  dd element is immediately followed by another dd element or a
  dt element, or if there is no more content in the parent element.
A p element's end tag may be omitted if the
  p element is immediately followed by an address, article,
  aside, blockquote, details, div, dl,
  fieldset, figcaption, figure, footer, form, h1, h2,
  h3, h4, h5, h6, header,
  hgroup, hr, main, menu, nav,
  ol, p, pre, section, table, or
  ul element, or if there is no more content in the parent element and the parent
  element is an HTML element that is not an a,
  audio, del, ins, map, noscript,
  or video element, or an autonomous custom element.

We can thus simplify the earlier example further:

   <!DOCTYPE HTML><title>Hello</title><p>Welcome to this example.

An rt element's end tag may be omitted if the
  rt element is immediately followed by an rt or rp element,
  or if there is no more content in the parent element.
An rp element's end tag may be omitted if the
  rp element is immediately followed by an rt or rp element,
  or if there is no more content in the parent element.
An optgroup element's end tag may be omitted
  if the optgroup element  is
  immediately followed by another optgroup element, or if  there is no more content in
  the parent element.
An option element's end tag may be omitted if
  the option element is immediately followed by another option element, or
  if it is immediately followed by an optgroup element, or if there is no more content
  in the parent element.
A colgroup element's start tag may be
  omitted if the first thing inside the colgroup element is a col element,
  and if the element is not immediately preceded by another colgroup element whose
  end tag has been omitted. (It can't be omitted if the element
  is empty.)
A colgroup element's end tag may be omitted
  if the colgroup element is not immediately followed by ASCII whitespace
  or a comment.
A caption element's end tag may be omitted if
  the caption element is not immediately followed by ASCII whitespace or a
  comment.
A thead element's end tag may be omitted if
  the thead element is immediately followed by a tbody or
  tfoot element.
A tbody element's start tag may be omitted
  if the first thing inside the tbody element is a tr element, and if the
  element is not immediately preceded by a tbody, thead, or
  tfoot element whose end tag has been omitted. (It
  can't be omitted if the element is empty.)
A tbody element's end tag may be omitted if
  the tbody element is immediately followed by a tbody or
  tfoot element, or if there is no more content in the parent element.
A tfoot element's end tag may be omitted if
  there is no more content in the parent element.
A tr element's end tag may be omitted if the
  tr element is immediately followed by another tr element, or if there is
  no more content in the parent element.
A td element's end tag may be omitted if the
  td element is immediately followed by a td or th element,
  or if there is no more content in the parent element.
A th element's end tag may be omitted if the
  th element is immediately followed by a td or th element,
  or if there is no more content in the parent element.

The ability to omit all these table-related tags makes table markup much terser.
Take this example:
<table>
 <caption>37547 TEE Electric Powered Rail Car Train Functions (Abbreviated)</caption>
 <colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Function</th>
   <th>Control Unit</th>
   <th>Central Station</th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>Headlights</td>
   <td>✔</td>
   <td>✔</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Interior Lights</td>
   <td>✔</td>
   <td>✔</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Electric locomotive operating sounds</td>
   <td>✔</td>
   <td>✔</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Engineer's cab lighting</td>
   <td></td>
   <td>✔</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Station Announcements - Swiss</td>
   <td></td>
   <td>✔</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
The exact same table, modulo some whitespace differences, could be marked up as follows:
<table>
 <caption>37547 TEE Electric Powered Rail Car Train Functions (Abbreviated)
 <colgroup><col><col><col>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Function
   <th>Control Unit
   <th>Central Station
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td>Headlights
   <td>✔
   <td>✔
  <tr>
   <td>Interior Lights
   <td>✔
   <td>✔
  <tr>
   <td>Electric locomotive operating sounds
   <td>✔
   <td>✔
  <tr>
   <td>Engineer's cab lighting
   <td>
   <td>✔
  <tr>
   <td>Station Announcements - Swiss
   <td>
   <td>✔
</table>
Since the cells take up much less room this way, this can be made even terser by having each
   row on one line:
<table>
 <caption>37547 TEE Electric Powered Rail Car Train Functions (Abbreviated)
 <colgroup><col><col><col>
 <thead>
  <tr> <th>Function                              <th>Control Unit     <th>Central Station
 <tbody>
  <tr> <td>Headlights                            <td>✔                <td>✔
  <tr> <td>Interior Lights                       <td>✔                <td>✔
  <tr> <td>Electric locomotive operating sounds  <td>✔                <td>✔
  <tr> <td>Engineer's cab lighting               <td>                 <td>✔
  <tr> <td>Station Announcements - Swiss         <td>                 <td>✔
</table>
The only differences between these tables, at the DOM level, is with the precise position of
   the (in any case semantically-neutral) whitespace.

However, a start tag must never be
  omitted if it has any attributes.

Returning to the earlier example with all the whitespace removed and then all the optional
   tags removed:
<!DOCTYPE HTML><title>Hello</title><p>Welcome to this example.
If the body element in this example had to have a class attribute and the html element had to have a lang attribute, the markup would have to become:
<!DOCTYPE HTML><html lang="en"><title>Hello</title><body class="demo"><p>Welcome to this example.

This section assumes that the document is conforming, in particular, that there
  are no content model violations. Omitting tags in the fashion
  described in this section in a document that does not conform to the content models
  described in this specification is likely to result in unexpected DOM differences (this is, in
  part, what the content models are designed to avoid).
13.1.2.5 Restrictions on content models
For historical reasons, certain elements have extra restrictions beyond even the restrictions
  given by their content model.
A table element must not contain tr elements, even though these
  elements are technically allowed inside table elements according to the content
  models described in this specification. (If a tr element is put inside a
  table in the markup, it will in fact imply a tbody start tag before
  it.)
A single newline may be placed immediately after the start tag of pre and textarea elements.
  This does not affect the processing of the element. The otherwise optional newline must be included if the element's contents
  themselves start with a newline (because otherwise the
  leading newline in the contents would be treated like the optional newline, and ignored).

The following two pre blocks are equivalent:
<pre>Hello</pre>
<pre>Hello</pre>

13.1.2.6 Restrictions on the contents of raw text and escapable raw text elements
The text in raw text and escapable raw text
  elements must not contain any occurrences of the string "</"
  (U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN, U+002F SOLIDUS) followed by characters that case-insensitively match the
  tag name of the element followed by one of U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab), U+000A LINE FEED
  (LF), U+000C FORM FEED (FF), U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR), U+0020 SPACE, U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN
  (>), or U+002F SOLIDUS (/).
13.1.3 Text
Text is allowed inside elements, attribute values, and comments.
  Extra constraints are placed on what is and what is not allowed in text based on where the text is
  to be put, as described in the other sections.
13.1.3.1 Newlines
Newlines in HTML may be represented either as U+000D
  CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters, U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters, or pairs of U+000D CARRIAGE
  RETURN (CR), U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters in that order.
Where character references are allowed, a character
  reference of a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character (but not a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character)
  also represents a newline.
13.1.4 Character references
In certain cases described in other sections, text may be
  mixed with character references. These can be used to escape
  characters that couldn't otherwise legally be included in text.
Character references must start with a U+0026 AMPERSAND character (&). Following this,
  there are three possible kinds of character references:
Named character referencesThe ampersand must be followed by one of the names given in the named character
   references section, using the same case. The name must be one that is
   terminated by a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;).Decimal numeric character referenceThe ampersand must be followed by a U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character (#), followed by one or more
   ASCII digits, representing a base-ten integer that corresponds to a code point that
   is allowed according to the definition below. The digits must then be followed by a U+003B

 <mn>3</mn>
 <mo>=</mo>
 <ms><![CDATA[x<y3]]></ms>
