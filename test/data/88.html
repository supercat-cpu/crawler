Set convert_charrefs in Pythons that support it.
Python 3.4 emits a warning suggesting that it be set, as it's going to default
to True in 3.5. http://bugs.python.org/issue13633
This causes tests to fail, LP: #1375721.
But don't set it to True, yet, so that we use our implementation in all
versions of Python.

Fix lxml deprecation warning tests.
The class BeautifulStoneSoup is instanciated first in
bs4.tests.test_soup:LXMLTreeBuilderSmokeTest.test_beautifulstonesoup_is_xml_parser
causing the UserWarning to be printed once. However, the deprecation test will
fail afterwards:
ERROR: test_beautifulstonesoup (bs4.tests.test_soup.TestDeprecatedConstructorArguments)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/root/Projects/python/beautifulsoup/bs4/tests/test_soup.py", line 69, in test_beautifulstonesoup
    self.assertTrue("BeautifulStoneSoup class is deprecated" in str(w[0].message))
IndexError: list index out of range
Instead, don't eat the UserWarning in the first test so that the second one can
catch it properly.
