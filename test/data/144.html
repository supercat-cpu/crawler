Looking at #1321, I made a mistake handling a merge conflict.

This re-removes stuff that is already in setup.cfg.
Edit: This also re-adds the python_requires option to setup.cfg which we should keep having in order for Use static setuptools metadata #1116 to be a neutral change.

Originally fixed in #1116
















    Sorry, something went wrong.

Since this is a technical change, and I've just cross-checked that everything removed here is still in setup.cfg, I will take responsibility.... together with the build verification ✔️
