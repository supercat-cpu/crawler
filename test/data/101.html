              # Octocat Classifier :octopus: :cat: :mag:

              ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-90%25-green) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-up%20to%20date-brightgreen)

              As the name suggests, Octocat Classifier is used to determine whether a given image contains an Octocat. It is trained with images from the [Octodex](1), images shared with [#MyOctocat on Twitter](2), and [photographs of laptops with :octocat: stickers on them]().

              ## Installation
