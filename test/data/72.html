More than just a static site  ¶          Built-in search  Material for MkDocs makes your documentation instantly searchable with zero effort: say goodbye to costly third-party crawler-based solutions that can take hours to update. Ship your documentation with a highly customizable  and blazing fast search running entirely in the user's browser at no extra cost.   Even better: search inside code blocks, exclude specific sections or entire pages, boost important pages in the results and build searchable documentation that works offline.       Learn more          Code annotations  Some examples need more explanation than others, which is why Material for MkDocs offers a unique and elegant way to add rich text almost anywhere in a code block.   Code annotations can host formatted text, images, diagrams, code blocks, call-outs, content tabs, even interactive elements – basically everything that can be expressed in Markdown or HTML. Of course, code annotations work beautifully on mobile and other touch devices  and can be printed.

While the social plugin uses what's already there, i.e. your project's name and logo, as well as each page's title and description, it's easy to customize preview images.

But you can always close most usability gaps with an awesome documentation experience. Expressed similarly in The Laws of Simplicity, "Learning makes things simpler". Material for MkDocs is the magical, extensible, Open Source tool that makes sharing knowledge both easier and beautiful for both the writers and learners.       Sebastián Ramírez  Creator of FastAPI, Typer & SQLModel    One of the things people like the most about FastAPI, Typer, and SQLModel, is the documentation. I have put a lot of effort into making it easy to study and fast to understand. And a key component of that is the richness of ways I can explain and show things with Material for MkDocs. It's so easy to structure and explain things using it with all its features! It's simple to use, immersive for visitors, and beautiful by default.       Michael Feng  Co-Founder & CEO of Hummingbot    Hummingbot Foundation depends on Material for MkDocs for our official website and documentation at hummingbot.org.
