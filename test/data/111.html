BTITLE Beautiful Soup: We called him Tortoise because he taught us.M0;115;0cETA Description Beautiful Soup: an HTML parser optimized for screen-scraping.


You didn't write that awful page. You're just trying to get some
data out of it.  Right now, you don't really care what HTML is
supposed to look like.

Neither does this parser.

Beautiful Soup is a Python HTML/XML parser designed for quick
turnaround projects like screen-scraping. Three features make it
powerful:


Beautiful Soup won't choke if you give it bad markup. It yields a
parse tree that makes approximately as much sense as your original
document. This is usually good enough to collect the data you need and
run away. 

Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms
for navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for
dissecting a document and extracting what you need. You don't have to
create a custom parser for each application.

Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to
Unicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don't have to think
about encodings, unless the document doesn't specify an encoding and
Beautiful Soup can't autodetect one. Then you just have to specify the
original encoding.


Beautiful Soup parses anything you give it, and does the tree
traversal stuff for you. You can tell it "Find all the links", or
"Find all the links of class externalLink", or "Find all the
links whose urls match "foo.com", or "Find the table heading that's
got bold text, then give me that text."

Valuable data that was once locked up in poorly-designed websites
is now within your reach. Projects that would have taken hours take
only minutes with Beautiful Soup.

Beautiful Soup 3 has been replaced
 by Beautiful
 Soup 4.
Beautiful Soup 3 only works on Python 2.x, but Beautiful Soup 4
 also works on Python 3.x. Beautiful Soup 4 is faster, has more
 features, and works with third-party parsers like lxml and
 html5lib. Once the beta period is over, you should use Beautiful Soup
 4 for all new projects.

The last series of Beautiful Soup 3 is the 3.2 series. The most recent release in this
series is 3.2.0,
released November 21, 2010.
If you're using Python 3.0, you must use Beautiful
 Soup 4.

No one should be using the 3.1 series anymore, but if you are, you're probably having problems.

Beautiful Soup is licensed under the same terms as Python itself,
so you can drop BeautifulSoup.py into almost any Python application
(or into your library path) and start using it immediately.

Older versions are still available:


The 1.x series works with Python 1.5
The 2.x series probably doesn't have much going for it anymore.
The 3.0.x series is known to work with Python 2.3.
