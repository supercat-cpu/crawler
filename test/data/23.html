Packaging Python ProjectsÂ¶
This tutorial walks you through how to package a simple Python project. It will
show you how to add the necessary files and structure to create the package, how
to build the package, and how to upload it to the Python Package Index (PyPI).

Tip
If you have trouble running the commands in this tutorial, please copy the command
and its output, then open an issue on the packaging-problems repository on
GitHub. Weâll do our best to help you!

Some of the commands require a newer version of pip, so start by making
sure you have the latest version installed:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip



Windows
py -m pip install --upgrade pip





A simple projectÂ¶
This tutorial uses a simple project named
example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE. If your username is me, then the
package would be example_package_me; this ensures that you have a unique
package name that doesnât conflict with packages uploaded by other people
following this tutorial. We recommend following this tutorial as-is using this
project, before packaging your own project.
Create the following file structure locally:
packaging_tutorial/
âââ src/
    âââ example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/
        âââ __init__.py
        âââ example.py


The directory containing the Python files should match the project name. This
simplifies the configuration and is more obvious to users who install the package.
__init__.py is required to import the directory as a package, and
should be empty.
example.py is an example of a module within the package that could
contain the logic (functions, classes, constants, etc.) of your package.
Open that file and enter the following content:
def add_one(number):
    return number + 1


If you are unfamiliar with Pythonâs modules and
import packages, take a few minutes to read over the
Python documentation for packages and modules.
Once you create this structure, youâll want to run all of the commands in this
tutorial within the packaging_tutorial directory.


Creating the package filesÂ¶
You will now add files that are used to prepare the project for distribution.
When youâre done, the project structure will look like this:
packaging_tutorial/
âââ LICENSE
âââ pyproject.toml
âââ README.md
âââ src/
â   âââ example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/
â       âââ __init__.py
â       âââ example.py
âââ tests/




Creating a test directoryÂ¶
tests/ is a placeholder for test files. Leave it empty for now.


Creating pyproject.tomlÂ¶
pyproject.toml tells âfrontendâ build tools like pip and
build what âbackendâ tool to use to create
distribution packages for your project.
You can choose from a number of backends; this tutorial uses Hatchling by default, but it will work identically with setuptools,
Flit, PDM, and others that support the [project]
table for metadata.

Note
Some build backends are part of larger tools that provide a command-line
interface with additional features like project initialization and version
management, as well as building, uploading, and installing packages. This
tutorial uses single-purpose tools that work independently.

Open pyproject.toml and enter one of these [build-system] tables:

Hatchling
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"



setuptools
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"



Flit
[build-system]
requires = ["flit_core>=3.2"]
build-backend = "flit_core.buildapi"



PDM
[build-system]
requires = ["pdm-pep517"]
build-backend = "pdm.pep517.api"





requires is a list of packages that are needed to build your package. You
donât need to install them; build frontends like pip will install them
automatically in a temporary, isolated virtual environment for use during the
build process.
build-backend is the name of the Python object that frontends will use to
perform the build.


Configuring metadataÂ¶
Open pyproject.toml and enter the following content. Change the name
to include your username; this ensures that you have a unique
package name that doesnât conflict with packages uploaded by other people
following this tutorial.
[project]
name = "example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE"
version = "0.0.1"
authors = [
  { name="Example Author", email="author@example.com" },
]
description = "A small example package"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.7"
classifiers = [
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
    "Operating System :: OS Independent",
]

[project.urls]
"Homepage" = "https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject"
"Bug Tracker" = "https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/issues"



name is the distribution name of your package. This can be any name as
long as it only contains letters, numbers, ., _ , and -. It also
must not already be taken on PyPI. Be sure to update this with your
username for this tutorial, as this ensures you wonât try to upload a
package with the same name as one which already exists.
version is the package version. See the version specifier specification
for more details on versions. Some build backends allow it to be specified
another way, such as from a file or a git tag.
authors is used to identify the author of the package; you specify a name
and an email for each author. You can also list maintainers in the same
format.
description is a short, one-sentence summary of the package.
readme is a path to a file containing a detailed description of the
package. This is shown on the package detail page on PyPI.
In this case, the description is loaded from README.md (which is a
common pattern). There also is a more advanced table form described in the
project metadata specification.
requires-python gives the versions of Python supported by your
project. Installers like pip will look back through older versions of
packages until it finds one that has a matching Python version.
classifiers gives the index and pip some additional metadata
about your package. In this case, the package is only compatible with Python
3, is licensed under the MIT license, and is OS-independent. You should
always include at least which version(s) of Python your package works on,
which license your package is available under, and which operating systems
your package will work on. For a complete list of classifiers, see
https://pypi.org/classifiers/.
urls lets you list any number of extra links to show on PyPI.
Generally this could be to the source, documentation, issue trackers, etc.

See the project metadata specification for
details on these and other fields that can be defined in the [project]
table. Other common fields are keywords to improve discoverability and the
dependencies that are required to install your package.



Creating README.mdÂ¶
Open README.md and enter the following content. You can customize this
if youâd like.
# Example Package

This is a simple example package. You can use
[Github-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
to write your content.




Creating a LICENSEÂ¶
Itâs important for every package uploaded to the Python Package Index to include
a license. This tells users who install your package the terms under which they
can use your package. For help picking a license, see
https://choosealicense.com/. Once you have chosen a license, open
LICENSE and enter the license text. For example, if you had chosen the
MIT license:
Copyright (c) 2018 The Python Packaging Authority

OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.


Most build backends automatically include license files in packages. See your
backendâs documentation for more details.


Including other filesÂ¶
The files listed above will be included automatically in your
source distribution. If you want to
include additional files, see the documentation for your build backend.


Generating distribution archivesÂ¶
The next step is to generate distribution packages
for the package. These are archives that are uploaded to the Python
Package Index and can be installed by pip.
Make sure you have the latest version of PyPAâs build installed:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build



Windows
py -m pip install --upgrade build





Tip
If you have trouble installing these, see the
Installing Packages tutorial.

Now run this command from the same directory where pyproject.toml is located:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m build



Windows
py -m build




This command should output a lot of text and once completed should generate two
files in the dist directory:
dist/
âââ example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
âââ example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1.tar.gz


The tar.gz file is a source distribution
whereas the .whl file is a built distribution.
Newer pip versions preferentially install built distributions, but will
fall back to source distributions if needed. You should always upload a source
distribution and provide built distributions for the platforms your project is
compatible with. In this case, our example package is compatible with Python on
any platform so only one built distribution is needed.


Uploading the distribution archivesÂ¶
Finally, itâs time to upload your package to the Python Package Index!
The first thing youâll need to do is register an account on TestPyPI, which
is a separate instance of the package index intended for testing and
experimentation. Itâs great for things like this tutorial where we donât
necessarily want to upload to the real index. To register an account, go to
https://test.pypi.org/account/register/ and complete the steps on that page.
You will also need to verify your email address before youâre able to upload
any packages.  For more details, see Using TestPyPI.
To securely upload your project, youâll need a PyPI API token. Create one at
https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens, setting the âScopeâ to âEntire
accountâ. Donât close the page until you have copied and saved the token â you
wonât see that token again.
Now that you are registered, you can use twine to upload the
distribution packages. Youâll need to install Twine:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine



Windows
py -m pip install --upgrade twine




Once installed, run Twine to upload all of the archives under dist:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*



Windows
py -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*




You will be prompted for a username and password. For the username,
use __token__. For the password, use the token value, including
the pypi- prefix.
After the command completes, you should see output similar to this:
Uploading distributions to https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
Enter your username: __token__
Uploading example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
100% ââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ 8.2/8.2 kB â¢ 00:01 â¢ ?
Uploading example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1.tar.gz
100% ââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ 6.8/6.8 kB â¢ 00:00 â¢ ?


Once uploaded, your package should be viewable on TestPyPI; for example:
https://test.pypi.org/project/example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE.


Installing your newly uploaded packageÂ¶
You can use pip to install your package and verify that it works.
Create a virtual environment
and install your package from TestPyPI:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps example-package-YOUR-USERNAME-HERE



Windows
py -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps example-package-YOUR-USERNAME-HERE




Make sure to specify your username in the package name!
pip should install the package from TestPyPI and the output should look
something like this:
Collecting example-package-YOUR-USERNAME-HERE
  Downloading https://test-files.pythonhosted.org/packages/.../example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE_0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
Installing collected packages: example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE
Successfully installed example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1



Note
This example uses --index-url flag to specify TestPyPI instead of
live PyPI. Additionally, it specifies --no-deps. Since TestPyPI doesnât
have the same packages as the live PyPI, itâs possible that attempting to
install dependencies may fail or install something unexpected. While our
example package doesnât have any dependencies, itâs a good practice to avoid
installing dependencies when using TestPyPI.

You can test that it was installed correctly by importing the package.
Make sure youâre still in your virtual environment, then run Python:

Unix/macOS
python3



Windows
py




and import the package:
>>> from example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE import example
>>> example.add_one(2)
3




Next stepsÂ¶
Congratulations, youâve packaged and distributed a Python project!
â¨ ð° â¨
Keep in mind that this tutorial showed you how to upload your package to Test
PyPI, which isnât a permanent storage. The Test system occasionally deletes
packages and accounts. It is best to use TestPyPI for testing and experiments
like this tutorial.
When you are ready to upload a real package to the Python Package Index you can
do much the same as you did in this tutorial, but with these important
differences:

Choose a memorable and unique name for your package. You donât have to append
your username as you did in the tutorial, but you canât use an existing name.
Register an account on https://pypi.org - note that these are two separate
servers and the login details from the test server are not shared with the
main server.
Use twine upload dist/* to upload your package and enter your credentials
for the account you registered on the real PyPI.  Now that youâre uploading
the package in production, you donât need to specify --repository; the
package will upload to https://pypi.org/ by default.
Install your package from the real PyPI using python3 -m pip install [your-package].

At this point if you want to read more on packaging Python libraries here are
some things you can do:

Consider packaging tools that provide a single command-line interface for
project management and packaging, such as hatch, flit,
pdm, and poetry.
Read PEP 517 and PEP 518 for background and details on build tool configuration.
Read about Packaging binary extensions.
