Donation for the Packaging Workgroup


















About the Packaging Workgroup
The purpose of this working group is to support the larger efforts of improving and maintaining the packaging ecosystem in Python through fundraising and disbursement of raised funds. It largely focuses on efforts such as PyPI, pip, packaging.python.org, setuptools, and cross-project efforts.

The working group is currently seeking funding for several new features and infrastructure improvements in packaging and distribution tools.
Your financial contribution to the Packaging Workgroup will be handled as a donation to the Python Software Foundation (PSF).
Note that it is not necessary to create an account on psfmember.org to use this form.

The Python Software Foundation is a non-profit organization entirely supported by its sponsor members and the public.  Our mission is to further the development of the Python language and its applications.
Payments are processed by PayPal, but may be made either through your existing PayPal account or your credit card.  You will choose your payment method after you are transferred to the PayPal server.
How the Donation Works
If you wish to use a credit card, once on the PayPal site click the link "Don't have a PayPal account?", which will take you to a credit card form.  A PayPal account is not required.
For your security, this website and the PSF do not acquire or retain any of your credit card data.  It is all handled by PayPal.
Following the transaction, you will receive both a PayPal receipt and/or our formal acknowledgement of your tax-deductible (USA) donation.
Please whitelist psfmember.org and check your spam bins if you don't receive the acknowledgement from the PSF.
The minimum donation is $5.  Thank you for your donation!
