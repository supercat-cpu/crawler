Introduction
RELAX NG is a schema language for XML.  The key features of RELAX
NG are that it:

is simple
is easy to learn
has both an XML syntax and a compact non-XML syntax
does not change the information set of an XML document
supports XML namespaces
treats attributes uniformly with elements so far as possible
has unrestricted support for unordered content
has unrestricted support for mixed content
has a solid theoretical basis
can partner with a separate datatyping language (such W3C XML Schema Datatypes)

The RELAX NG specifications have been developed within OASIS by the RELAX NG
Technical Committeee.  RELAX NG is also an
International Standard (ISO/IEC 19757-2).
It is Part 2 of ISO/IEC 19757 DSDL (Document Schema Definition Languages),
which is maintained by ISO/IEC
JTC1/SC34/WG1.
RELAX NG was based on TREX designed by James
Clark and RELAX Core designed by 
MURATA Makoto.
 project for extending RELAX NG has started 
in ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG1.  RELAX NG Version 2 is likely to become a new part of ISO/IEC 19757, while RELAX NG Version 1 continues to exist
as Part 2 of ISO/IEC 19757.

Conversion tools
Trang,
multi-format schema converter based on RELAX NG. Trang supports the
following languages: RELAX NG (both XML and compact syntax), XML 1.0
DTDs, W3C XML Schema.  A schema written in any of the supported schema
languages can be converted into any of the other supported schema
languages, except that W3C XML Schema is supported for output only,
not for input.  Trang can also infer a schema from one or more example
XML documents. Trang aims to produce human-understandable schemas; it
tries to preserve all aspects of the input schema that may be
significant to a human reader, including the definitions, the way the
schema is divided into files, annotations and comments.  Uses Jing.
Implemented in Java. Written by James Clark. Open source (BSD
license).
Sun
RELAX NG Converter. The Sun RELAX NG Converter is a tool to
convert schemas written in various schema languages to their
equivalent in RELAX NG. It supports schemas written in XML DTD, RELAX
Core, RELAX namespace, TREX, W3C XML Schema, and RELAX NG itself.  It
does aims only to produce a RELAX NG schema that is equivalent to the
input schema in the sense that it validates the same documents as the
input schema; it does not aim to preserve information that is not
significant for validation such as the use of definitions.  Based on
MSV.  Implemented in Java. Written by Kohsuke KAWAGUCHI. Open source
(BSD license).
XSD to RelaxNG.   web-based converter from W3C XML Schema to RELAX NG.  The user 
types a WXS schema in this web form, and 
gets a RELAX NG schema with the convert button.  The conversion is done by an XSLT stylesheet.

syntax.  The simple syntax is a minimal subset of the XML syntax
defined by the RELAX NG specification, into which any RELAX NG schema
can be transformed.  Uses Jing. Implemented in Java. Written by
Kohsuke KAWAGUCHI. Open source (BSD license).
NekoDTD,
DTD to instance converter. Uses the Xerces Native Interface (XNI) to
convert DTD into an XML document, which can then be converted into
other formats. Includes XSLT stylesheets to convert XML output format
into RELAX NG. Implemented in Java. Written by Andy Clark. Open source
(Apache-style license).
RNG to RNC Converter.
Contains XSLT stylesheets for converting RELAX NG schemas
in the XML syntax to the compact syntax. The stylesheets can output
either a plain text result, or a hyperlinked HTML document.
