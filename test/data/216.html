xmltramp: Make XML documents easily accessible.


Everyone's got their data in XML these days. You need to read it. You've looked at the other XML APIs and they all contain miles of crud that's only necessary when parsing the most arcane documents. Wouldn't it be nice to have an easy-to-use API for the normal XML documents you deal with? That's xmltramp:

>>> import xmltramp
>>> doc = xmltramp.Namespace("http://example.org/bar")
>>> bbc = xmltramp.Namespace("http://example.org/bbc")
>>> dc = xmltramp.Namespace("http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/")
>>> d = xmltramp.parse("""<doc version="2.7182818284590451"
  xmlns="http://example.org/bar" 
  xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
  xmlns:bbc="http://example.org/bbc">
	<author><name>John Polk</name> and <name>John Palfrey</name></author>
	<dc:creator>John Polk</dc:creator>
	<dc:creator>John Palfrey</dc:creator>
	<bbc:show bbc:station="4">Buffy</bbc:show>
</doc>""")
>>> d
<doc version="2.7182818284590451">...</doc>
>>> d('version')
'2.7182818284590451'
>>> d(version='2.0')
>>> d('version')
'2.0'
>>> d._dir
[<author>...</author>, <dc:creator>...</dc:creator>, <dc:creator>...</dc:creator>, <bbc:show bbc:station="4">...</bbc:show>]
>>> d._name
(u'http://example.org/bar', u'doc')
>>> d[0]                # First child.
<author>...</author>
>>> d.author            # First author.
<author>...</author>
>>> str(d.author)
'John Polk and John Palfrey'
>>> d[dc.creator]        # First dc:creator.
<dc:creator>...</dc:creator>
>>> d[dc.creator:]       # All creators.
[<dc:creator>...</dc:creator>, <dc:creator>...</dc:creator>]
>>> d[dc.creator] = "Me!!!"
>>> str(d[dc.creator])
'Me!!!'
>>> d[bbc.show](bbc.station)
'4'
>>> d[bbc.show](bbc.station, '5')
>>> d[bbc.show](bbc.station)
'5'

"xmltramp is good software. It's the simplest way I know of to handle XML content. Sort of like DOM but without all the obnoxious function calls." -- Nelson Minar
