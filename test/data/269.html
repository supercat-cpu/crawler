BlinkFlash - the unofficial winkflash commandline client


;> BlinkFlash 1.3  -is broken :(
 The unofficial winkflash commandline client
 BlinkFlash does not work anymore. It scraps the winkflash website which changed a few years after I wrote this program. I may fix it in the future but like everyone time is short.
Summary
BlinkFlash is a commandline tool for uploading images to winkflash, a mail order digital photo printer. It is a script that automates the Web-based file upload process. It can also create new albums, set photo notes (which are printed on the backs of photos) and download photos.
Requirements and Download
BlinkFlash is written in python and uses a few extra python libraries
 which are included in the download (
  ClientCookie,
  ClientForm and
  BeautifulSoup).
 The only dependency is python 2.3 
 It is intended for Linux users (that's what I use) but as its written in python it may work on other platforms.
You can download it here
Background
 I use winkflash for printing
my digital photos. At the time of writing (October 2004 -still true November 2005)
they provide a very efficient service, have a reasonable
and simple pricing structure (99p + 9p per photo, or 99c + 12c in the USA) and
will even print notes on the back of the photos for you.
My only problem has been that none of their 3 uploading
options work for me. They have a windows upload tool
but I don't use windows, there is a java applet which
has never worked for me and finally they have a web based
facility. In the past I have used the web based interface
but it takes ages to add the photos one at a time and
editing a photo's notes requires 3 clicks per photo.
I decided to automate this process and create a command line
client which uses the web based upload facility as a backend.
So I wrote blinkflash (faster than winkflash).

winkflash know nothing about blinkflash. If you get
in trouble for using this (I can't think why) I can't
be held responsible.
