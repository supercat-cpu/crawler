» lxml takes all the pain out of XML. «
Stephan Richter

lxml is the most feature-rich
and easy-to-use library
for processing XML and HTML
in the Python language.

Introduction
The lxml XML toolkit is a Pythonic binding for the C libraries
libxml2 and libxslt.  It is unique in that it combines the speed and
XML feature completeness of these libraries with the simplicity of a
native Python API, mostly compatible but superior to the well-known
ElementTree API.  The latest release works with all CPython versions
from 2.6 to 3.6.  See the introduction for more information about
background and goals of the lxml project.  Some common questions are
answered in the FAQ.

Support the project
lxml has been downloaded from the Python Package Index more than
two million times and is also available directly in many package
distributions, e.g. for Linux or MacOS-X.
Most people who use lxml do so because they like using it.
You can show us that you like it by blogging about your experience
with it and linking to the project website.
If you are using lxml for your work and feel like giving a bit of
your own benefit back to support the project, consider sending us
money through PayPal that we can use for fixing bugs in the software
and improving its features and documentation.  Please read the Legal
Notice below, at the bottom of this page.  Thank you for your support.

Please contact Stefan Behnel for other ways to support the lxml project,
as well as commercial consulting, customisations and trainings on lxml and
fast Python XML processing.



Documentation
The complete lxml documentation is available for download as PDF
documentation.  The HTML documentation from this web site is part of
the normal source download.

Tutorials:
the lxml.etree tutorial for XML processing
John Shipman's tutorial on Python XML processing with lxml
Fredrik Lundh's tutorial for ElementTree


ElementTree:
ElementTree API
compatibility and differences of lxml.etree
ElementTree performance characteristics and comparison


lxml.etree:
lxml.etree specific API documentation
the generated API documentation as a reference
parsing and validating XML
XPath and XSLT support
Python XPath extension functions for XPath and XSLT
custom XML element classes for custom XML APIs (see EuroPython 2008 talk)
a SAX compliant API for interfacing with other XML tools
a C-level API for interfacing with external C/Cython modules


lxml.objectify:
lxml.objectify API documentation
a brief comparison of objectify and etree



lxml.etree follows the ElementTree API as much as possible, building
it on top of the native libxml2 tree.  If you are new to ElementTree,
start with the lxml.etree tutorial for XML processing.  See also the
ElementTree compatibility overview and the ElementTree performance
page comparing lxml to the original ElementTree and cElementTree
implementations.
Right after the lxml.etree tutorial for XML processing and the
ElementTree documentation, the next place to look is the lxml.etree
specific API documentation.  It describes how lxml extends the
ElementTree API to expose libxml2 and libxslt specific XML
functionality, such as XPath, Relax NG, XML Schema, XSLT, and
c14n.  Python code can be called from XPath expressions and XSLT
stylesheets through the use of XPath extension functions.  lxml
also offers a SAX compliant API, that works with the SAX support in
the standard library.
There is a separate module lxml.objectify that implements a data-binding
API on top of lxml.etree.  See the objectify and etree FAQ entry for a
comparison.
In addition to the ElementTree API, lxml also features a sophisticated
API for custom XML element classes.  This is a simple way to write
arbitrary XML driven APIs on top of lxml.  lxml.etree also has a
C-level API that can be used to efficiently extend lxml.etree in
external C modules, including fast custom element class support.


Download
The best way to download lxml is to visit lxml at the Python Package
Index (PyPI).  It has the source
that compiles on various platforms.  The source distribution is signed
with this key.
The latest version is lxml 3.8.0, released 2017-06-03
(changes for 3.8.0).  Older versions
are listed below.
Please take a look at the
installation instructions !
This complete web site (including the generated API documentation) is
part of the source distribution, so if you want to download the
documentation for offline use, take the source archive and copy the
doc/html directory out of the source tree, or use the
PDF documentation.
The latest installable developer sources should usually be available from the
build server.  It's also possible to check out
the latest development version of lxml from github directly, using a command
like this (assuming you use hg and have hg-git installed):

hg clone git+ssh://git@github.com/lxml/lxml.git lxml

Alternatively, if you use git, this should work as well:

git clone https://github.com/lxml/lxml.git lxml

You can browse the source repository and its history through
the web.  Please read how to build lxml from source
first.  The latest CHANGES of the developer version are also
accessible.  You can check there if a bug you found has been fixed
or a feature you want has been implemented in the latest trunk version.


Mailing list
Questions? Suggestions? Code to contribute? We have a mailing list.
You can search the archive with Gmane or Google.


Bug tracker
lxml uses the launchpad bug tracker.  If you are sure you found a
bug in lxml, please file a bug report there.  If you are not sure
whether some unexpected behaviour of lxml is a bug or not, please
check the documentation and ask on the mailing list first.  Do not
forget to search the archive (e.g. with Gmane)!


License
The lxml library is shipped under a BSD license. libxml2 and libxslt2
itself are shipped under the MIT license. There should therefore be no
obstacle to using lxml in your codebase.
