Beautiful Soup DocumentationÂ¶

Beautiful Soup is a
Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works
with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating,
searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers
hours or days of work.
These instructions illustrate all major features of Beautiful Soup 4,
with examples. I show you what the library is good for, how it works,
how to use it, how to make it do what you want, and what to do when it
violates your expectations.
This document covers Beautiful Soup version 4.8.1. The examples in
this documentation should work the same way in Python 2.7 and Python
3.2.
You might be looking for the documentation for Beautiful Soup 3.
If so, you should know that Beautiful Soup 3 is no longer being
developed and that support for it will be dropped on or after December
31, 2020. If you want to learn about the differences between Beautiful
Soup 3 and Beautiful Soup 4, see Porting code to BS4.
This documentation has been translated into other languages by
Beautiful Soup users:

Getting helpÂ¶
If you have questions about Beautiful Soup, or run into problems,
send mail to the discussion group. If
your problem involves parsing an HTML document, be sure to mention
what the diagnose() function says about
that document.



Quick StartÂ¶
Hereâs an HTML document Iâll be using as an example throughout this
document. Itâs part of a story from Alice in Wonderland:
html_doc = """
<html><head><title>The Dormouse's story</title></head>
<body>
<p class="title"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p>

<p class="story">Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were
<a href="http://example.com/elsie" class="sister" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
<a href="http://example.com/lacie" class="sister" id="link2">Lacie</a> and
<a href="http://example.com/tillie" class="sister" id="link3">Tillie</a>;
and they lived at the bottom of a well.</p>

<p class="story">...</p>
"""


Running the âthree sistersâ document through Beautiful Soup gives us a
BeautifulSoup object, which represents the document as a nested
data structure:
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'html.parser')

print(soup.prettify())
# <html>
#  <head>
#   <title>
#    The Dormouse's story
#   </title>
#  </head>
#  <body>
#   <p class="title">
#    <b>
#     The Dormouse's story
#    </b>
#   </p>
#   <p class="story">
#    Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were
#    <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">
#     Elsie
#    </a>
#    ,
#    <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">
#     Lacie
#    </a>
#    and
#    <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link2">
#     Tillie
#    </a>
#    ; and they lived at the bottom of a well.
#   </p>
#   <p class="story">
#    ...
#   </p>
#  </body>
# </html>


Here are some simple ways to navigate that data structure:
soup.title
# <title>The Dormouse's story</title>

soup.title.name
# u'title'

soup.title.string
# u'The Dormouse's story'

soup.title.parent.name
# u'head'

soup.p
# <p class="title"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p>

soup.p['class']
# u'title'

soup.a
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>

soup.find_all('a')
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]

soup.find(id="link3")
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>


One common task is extracting all the URLs found within a pageâs <a> tags:
for link in soup.find_all('a'):
    print(link.get('href'))
# http://example.com/elsie
# http://example.com/lacie
# http://example.com/tillie


Another common task is extracting all the text from a page:
print(soup.get_text())
# The Dormouse's story
#
# The Dormouse's story
#
# Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were
# Elsie,
# Lacie and
# Tillie;
# and they lived at the bottom of a well.
#
# ...


Does this look like what you need? If so, read on.


Installing Beautiful SoupÂ¶
If youâre using a recent version of Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can
install Beautiful Soup with the system package manager:
$ apt-get install python-bs4 (for Python 2)
$ apt-get install python3-bs4 (for Python 3)
Beautiful Soup 4 is published through PyPi, so if you canât install it
with the system packager, you can install it with easy_install or
pip. The package name is beautifulsoup4, and the same package
works on Python 2 and Python 3. Make sure you use the right version of
pip or easy_install for your Python version (these may be named
pip3 and easy_install3 respectively if youâre using Python 3).
$ easy_install beautifulsoup4
$ pip install beautifulsoup4
(The BeautifulSoup package is probably not what you want. Thatâs
the previous major release, Beautiful Soup 3. Lots of software uses
BS3, so itâs still available, but if youâre writing new code you
should install beautifulsoup4.)
If you donât have easy_install or pip installed, you can
download the Beautiful Soup 4 source tarball and
install it with setup.py.
$ python setup.py install
If all else fails, the license for Beautiful Soup allows you to
package the entire library with your application. You can download the
tarball, copy its bs4 directory into your applicationâs codebase,
and use Beautiful Soup without installing it at all.
I use Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 to develop Beautiful Soup, but it
should work with other recent versions.

Problems after installationÂ¶
Beautiful Soup is packaged as Python 2 code. When you install it for
use with Python 3, itâs automatically converted to Python 3 code. If
you donât install the package, the code wonât be converted. There have
also been reports on Windows machines of the wrong version being
installed.
If you get the ImportError âNo module named HTMLParserâ, your
problem is that youâre running the Python 2 version of the code under
Python 3.
If you get the ImportError âNo module named html.parserâ, your
problem is that youâre running the Python 3 version of the code under
Python 2.
In both cases, your best bet is to completely remove the Beautiful
Soup installation from your system (including any directory created
when you unzipped the tarball) and try the installation again.
If you get the SyntaxError âInvalid syntaxâ on the line
ROOT_TAG_NAME = u'[document]', you need to convert the Python 2
code to Python 3. You can do this either by installing the package:
$ python3 setup.py install
or by manually running Pythonâs 2to3 conversion script on the
bs4 directory:
$ 2to3-3.2 -w bs4


Installing a parserÂ¶
Beautiful Soup supports the HTML parser included in Pythonâs standard
library, but it also supports a number of third-party Python parsers.
One is the lxml parser. Depending on your setup,
you might install lxml with one of these commands:
$ apt-get install python-lxml
$ easy_install lxml
$ pip install lxml
Another alternative is the pure-Python html5lib parser, which parses HTML the way a
web browser does. Depending on your setup, you might install html5lib
with one of these commands:
$ apt-get install python-html5lib
$ easy_install html5lib
$ pip install html5lib
This table summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each parser library:








Parser
Typical usage
Advantages
Disadvantages

Pythonâs html.parser
BeautifulSoup(markup, "html.parser")

Batteries included
Decent speed
Lenient (As of Python 2.7.3
and 3.2.)



Not as fast as lxml,
less lenient than
html5lib.



lxmlâs HTML parser
BeautifulSoup(markup, "lxml")

Very fast
Lenient



External C dependency



lxmlâs XML parser
BeautifulSoup(markup, "lxml-xml")
BeautifulSoup(markup, "xml")

Very fast
The only currently supported
XML parser



External C dependency



html5lib
BeautifulSoup(markup, "html5lib")

Extremely lenient
Parses pages the same way a
web browser does
Creates valid HTML5



Very slow
External Python
dependency





If you can, I recommend you install and use lxml for speed. If youâre
using a version of Python 2 earlier than 2.7.3, or a version of Python
3 earlier than 3.2.2, itâs essential that you install lxml or
html5libâPythonâs built-in HTML parser is just not very good in older
versions.
Note that if a document is invalid, different parsers will generate
different Beautiful Soup trees for it. See Differences
between parsers for details.



Making the soupÂ¶
To parse a document, pass it into the BeautifulSoup
constructor. You can pass in a string or an open filehandle:
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

with open("index.html") as fp:
    soup = BeautifulSoup(fp)

soup = BeautifulSoup("<html>data</html>")


First, the document is converted to Unicode, and HTML entities are
converted to Unicode characters:
BeautifulSoup("Sacr&eacute; bleu!")
<html><head></head><body>SacrÃ© bleu!</body></html>


Beautiful Soup then parses the document using the best available
parser. It will use an HTML parser unless you specifically tell it to
use an XML parser. (See Parsing XML.)


Kinds of objectsÂ¶
Beautiful Soup transforms a complex HTML document into a complex tree
of Python objects. But youâll only ever have to deal with about four
kinds of objects: Tag, NavigableString, BeautifulSoup,
and Comment.

TagÂ¶
A Tag object corresponds to an XML or HTML tag in the original document:
soup = BeautifulSoup('<b class="boldest">Extremely bold</b>')
tag = soup.b
type(tag)
# <class 'bs4.element.Tag'>


Tags have a lot of attributes and methods, and Iâll cover most of them
in Navigating the tree and Searching the tree. For now, the most
important features of a tag are its name and attributes.

NameÂ¶
Every tag has a name, accessible as .name:
tag.name
# u'b'


If you change a tagâs name, the change will be reflected in any HTML
markup generated by Beautiful Soup:
tag.name = "blockquote"
tag
# <blockquote class="boldest">Extremely bold</blockquote>




AttributesÂ¶
A tag may have any number of attributes. The tag <b
id="boldest"> has an attribute âidâ whose value is
âboldestâ. You can access a tagâs attributes by treating the tag like
a dictionary:
tag['id']
# u'boldest'


You can access that dictionary directly as .attrs:
tag.attrs
# {u'id': 'boldest'}


You can add, remove, and modify a tagâs attributes. Again, this is
done by treating the tag as a dictionary:
tag['id'] = 'verybold'
tag['another-attribute'] = 1
tag
# <b another-attribute="1" id="verybold"></b>

del tag['id']
del tag['another-attribute']
tag
# <b></b>

tag['id']
# KeyError: 'id'
print(tag.get('id'))
# None



Multi-valued attributesÂ¶
HTML 4 defines a few attributes that can have multiple values. HTML 5
removes a couple of them, but defines a few more. The most common
multi-valued attribute is class (that is, a tag can have more than
one CSS class). Others include rel, rev, accept-charset,
headers, and accesskey. Beautiful Soup presents the value(s)
of a multi-valued attribute as a list:
css_soup = BeautifulSoup('<p class="body"></p>')
css_soup.p['class']
# ["body"]

css_soup = BeautifulSoup('<p class="body strikeout"></p>')
css_soup.p['class']
# ["body", "strikeout"]


If an attribute looks like it has more than one value, but itâs not
a multi-valued attribute as defined by any version of the HTML
standard, Beautiful Soup will leave the attribute alone:
id_soup = BeautifulSoup('<p id="my id"></p>')
id_soup.p['id']
# 'my id'


When you turn a tag back into a string, multiple attribute values are
consolidated:
rel_soup = BeautifulSoup('<p>Back to the <a rel="index">homepage</a></p>')
rel_soup.a['rel']
# ['index']
rel_soup.a['rel'] = ['index', 'contents']
print(rel_soup.p)
# <p>Back to the <a rel="index contents">homepage</a></p>


You can disable this by passing multi_valued_attributes=None as a
keyword argument into the BeautifulSoup constructor:
no_list_soup = BeautifulSoup('<p class="body strikeout"></p>', 'html', multi_valued_attributes=None)
no_list_soup.p['class']
# u'body strikeout'


You can use `get_attribute_list to get a value thatâs always a
list, whether or not itâs a multi-valued atribute:
id_soup.p.get_attribute_list('id')
# ["my id"]


If you parse a document as XML, there are no multi-valued attributes:
xml_soup = BeautifulSoup('<p class="body strikeout"></p>', 'xml')
xml_soup.p['class']
# u'body strikeout'


Again, you can configure this using the multi_valued_attributes argument:
class_is_multi= { '*' : 'class'}
xml_soup = BeautifulSoup('<p class="body strikeout"></p>', 'xml', multi_valued_attributes=class_is_multi)
xml_soup.p['class']
# [u'body', u'strikeout']


You probably wonât need to do this, but if you do, use the defaults as
a guide. They implement the rules described in the HTML specification:
from bs4.builder import builder_registry
builder_registry.lookup('html').DEFAULT_CDATA_LIST_ATTRIBUTES






NavigableStringÂ¶
A string corresponds to a bit of text within a tag. Beautiful Soup
uses the NavigableString class to contain these bits of text:
tag.string
# u'Extremely bold'
type(tag.string)
# <class 'bs4.element.NavigableString'>


A NavigableString is just like a Python Unicode string, except
that it also supports some of the features described in Navigating
the tree and Searching the tree. You can convert a
NavigableString to a Unicode string with unicode():
unicode_string = unicode(tag.string)
unicode_string
# u'Extremely bold'
type(unicode_string)
# <type 'unicode'>


You canât edit a string in place, but you can replace one string with
another, using replace_with():
tag.string.replace_with("No longer bold")
tag
# <blockquote>No longer bold</blockquote>


NavigableString supports most of the features described in
Navigating the tree and Searching the tree, but not all of
them. In particular, since a string canât contain anything (the way a
tag may contain a string or another tag), strings donât support the
.contents or .string attributes, or the find() method.
If you want to use a NavigableString outside of Beautiful Soup,
you should call unicode() on it to turn it into a normal Python
Unicode string. If you donât, your string will carry around a
reference to the entire Beautiful Soup parse tree, even when youâre
done using Beautiful Soup. This is a big waste of memory.


BeautifulSoupÂ¶
The BeautifulSoup object represents the parsed document as a
whole. For most purposes, you can treat it as a Tag
object. This means it supports most of the methods described in
Navigating the tree and Searching the tree.
You can also pass a BeautifulSoup object into one of the methods
defined in Modifying the tree, just as you would a Tag. This
lets you do things like combine two parsed documents:
doc = BeautifulSoup("<document><content/>INSERT FOOTER HERE</document", "xml")
footer = BeautifulSoup("<footer>Here's the footer</footer>", "xml")
doc.find(text="INSERT FOOTER HERE").replace_with(footer)
# u'INSERT FOOTER HERE'
print(doc)
# <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
# <document><content/><footer>Here's the footer</footer></document>


Since the BeautifulSoup object doesnât correspond to an actual
HTML or XML tag, it has no name and no attributes. But sometimes itâs
useful to look at its .name, so itâs been given the special
.name â[document]â:
soup.name
# u'[document]'




Comments and other special stringsÂ¶
Tag, NavigableString, and BeautifulSoup cover almost
everything youâll see in an HTML or XML file, but there are a few
leftover bits. The only one youâll probably ever need to worry about
is the comment:
markup = "<b><!--Hey, buddy. Want to buy a used parser?--></b>"
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup)
comment = soup.b.string
type(comment)
# <class 'bs4.element.Comment'>


The Comment object is just a special type of NavigableString:
comment
# u'Hey, buddy. Want to buy a used parser'


But when it appears as part of an HTML document, a Comment is
displayed with special formatting:
print(soup.b.prettify())
# <b>
#  <!--Hey, buddy. Want to buy a used parser?-->
# </b>


Beautiful Soup defines classes for anything else that might show up in
an XML document: CData, ProcessingInstruction,
Declaration, and Doctype. Just like Comment, these classes
are subclasses of NavigableString that add something extra to the
string. Hereâs an example that replaces the comment with a CDATA
block:
from bs4 import CData
cdata = CData("A CDATA block")
comment.replace_with(cdata)

print(soup.b.prettify())
# <b>
#  <![CDATA[A CDATA block]]>
# </b>





Navigating the treeÂ¶
Hereâs the âThree sistersâ HTML document again:
html_doc = """
<html><head><title>The Dormouse's story</title></head>
<body>
<p class="title"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p>

<p class="story">Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were
<a href="http://example.com/elsie" class="sister" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
<a href="http://example.com/lacie" class="sister" id="link2">Lacie</a> and
<a href="http://example.com/tillie" class="sister" id="link3">Tillie</a>;
and they lived at the bottom of a well.</p>

<p class="story">...</p>
"""

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'html.parser')


Iâll use this as an example to show you how to move from one part of
a document to another.

Going downÂ¶
Tags may contain strings and other tags. These elements are the tagâs
children. Beautiful Soup provides a lot of different attributes for
navigating and iterating over a tagâs children.
Note that Beautiful Soup strings donât support any of these
attributes, because a string canât have children.

Navigating using tag namesÂ¶
The simplest way to navigate the parse tree is to say the name of the
tag you want. If you want the <head> tag, just say soup.head:
soup.head
# <head><title>The Dormouse's story</title></head>

soup.title
# <title>The Dormouse's story</title>


You can do use this trick again and again to zoom in on a certain part
of the parse tree. This code gets the first <b> tag beneath the <body> tag:
soup.body.b
# <b>The Dormouse's story</b>


Using a tag name as an attribute will give you only the first tag by that
name:
soup.a
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>


If you need to get all the <a> tags, or anything more complicated
than the first tag with a certain name, youâll need to use one of the
methods described in Searching the tree, such as find_all():
soup.find_all('a')
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]




.contents and .childrenÂ¶
A tagâs children are available in a list called .contents:
head_tag = soup.head
head_tag
# <head><title>The Dormouse's story</title></head>

head_tag.contents
[<title>The Dormouse's story</title>]

title_tag = head_tag.contents[0]
title_tag
# <title>The Dormouse's story</title>
title_tag.contents
# [u'The Dormouse's story']


The BeautifulSoup object itself has children. In this case, the
<html> tag is the child of the BeautifulSoup object.:
len(soup.contents)
# 1
soup.contents[0].name
# u'html'


A string does not have .contents, because it canât contain
anything:
text = title_tag.contents[0]
text.contents
# AttributeError: 'NavigableString' object has no attribute 'contents'


Instead of getting them as a list, you can iterate over a tagâs
children using the .children generator:
for child in title_tag.children:
    print(child)
# The Dormouse's story




.descendantsÂ¶
The .contents and .children attributes only consider a tagâs
direct children. For instance, the <head> tag has a single direct
childâthe <title> tag:
head_tag.contents
# [<title>The Dormouse's story</title>]


But the <title> tag itself has a child: the string âThe Dormouseâs
storyâ. Thereâs a sense in which that string is also a child of the
<head> tag. The .descendants attribute lets you iterate over all
of a tagâs children, recursively: its direct children, the children of
its direct children, and so on:
for child in head_tag.descendants:
    print(child)
# <title>The Dormouse's story</title>
# The Dormouse's story


The <head> tag has only one child, but it has two descendants: the
<title> tag and the <title> tagâs child. The BeautifulSoup object
only has one direct child (the <html> tag), but it has a whole lot of
descendants:
len(list(soup.children))
# 1
len(list(soup.descendants))
# 25




.stringÂ¶
If a tag has only one child, and that child is a NavigableString,
the child is made available as .string:
title_tag.string
# u'The Dormouse's story'


If a tagâs only child is another tag, and that tag has a
.string, then the parent tag is considered to have the same
.string as its child:
head_tag.contents
# [<title>The Dormouse's story</title>]

head_tag.string
# u'The Dormouse's story'


If a tag contains more than one thing, then itâs not clear what
.string should refer to, so .string is defined to be
None:
print(soup.html.string)
# None




.strings and stripped_stringsÂ¶
If thereâs more than one thing inside a tag, you can still look at
just the strings. Use the .strings generator:
for string in soup.strings:
    print(repr(string))
# u"The Dormouse's story"
# u'\n\n'
# u"The Dormouse's story"
# u'\n\n'
# u'Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were\n'
# u'Elsie'
# u',\n'
# u'Lacie'
# u' and\n'
# u'Tillie'
# u';\nand they lived at the bottom of a well.'
# u'\n\n'
# u'...'
# u'\n'


These strings tend to have a lot of extra whitespace, which you can
remove by using the .stripped_strings generator instead:
for string in soup.stripped_strings:
    print(repr(string))
# u"The Dormouse's story"
# u"The Dormouse's story"
# u'Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were'
# u'Elsie'
# u','
# u'Lacie'
# u'and'
# u'Tillie'
# u';\nand they lived at the bottom of a well.'
# u'...'


Here, strings consisting entirely of whitespace are ignored, and
whitespace at the beginning and end of strings is removed.



Going upÂ¶
Continuing the âfamily treeâ analogy, every tag and every string has a
parent: the tag that contains it.

.parentÂ¶
You can access an elementâs parent with the .parent attribute. In
the example âthree sistersâ document, the <head> tag is the parent
of the <title> tag:
title_tag = soup.title
title_tag
# <title>The Dormouse's story</title>
title_tag.parent
# <head><title>The Dormouse's story</title></head>


The title string itself has a parent: the <title> tag that contains
it:
title_tag.string.parent
# <title>The Dormouse's story</title>


The parent of a top-level tag like <html> is the BeautifulSoup object
itself:
html_tag = soup.html
type(html_tag.parent)
# <class 'bs4.BeautifulSoup'>


And the .parent of a BeautifulSoup object is defined as None:
print(soup.parent)
# None




.parentsÂ¶
You can iterate over all of an elementâs parents with
.parents. This example uses .parents to travel from an <a> tag
buried deep within the document, to the very top of the document:
link = soup.a
link
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>
for parent in link.parents:
    if parent is None:
        print(parent)
    else:
        print(parent.name)
# p
# body
# html
# [document]
# None





Going sidewaysÂ¶
Consider a simple document like this:
sibling_soup = BeautifulSoup("<a><b>text1</b><c>text2</c></b></a>")
print(sibling_soup.prettify())
# <html>
#  <body>
#   <a>
#    <b>
#     text1
#    </b>
#    <c>
#     text2
#    </c>
#   </a>
#  </body>
# </html>


The <b> tag and the <c> tag are at the same level: theyâre both direct
children of the same tag. We call them siblings. When a document is
pretty-printed, siblings show up at the same indentation level. You
can also use this relationship in the code you write.

.next_sibling and .previous_siblingÂ¶
You can use .next_sibling and .previous_sibling to navigate
between page elements that are on the same level of the parse tree:
sibling_soup.b.next_sibling
# <c>text2</c>

sibling_soup.c.previous_sibling
# <b>text1</b>


The <b> tag has a .next_sibling, but no .previous_sibling,
because thereâs nothing before the <b> tag on the same level of the
tree. For the same reason, the <c> tag has a .previous_sibling
but no .next_sibling:
print(sibling_soup.b.previous_sibling)
# None
print(sibling_soup.c.next_sibling)
# None


The strings âtext1â and âtext2â are not siblings, because they donât
have the same parent:
sibling_soup.b.string
# u'text1'

print(sibling_soup.b.string.next_sibling)
# None


In real documents, the .next_sibling or .previous_sibling of a
tag will usually be a string containing whitespace. Going back to the
âthree sistersâ document:
<a href="http://example.com/elsie" class="sister" id="link1">Elsie</a>
<a href="http://example.com/lacie" class="sister" id="link2">Lacie</a>
<a href="http://example.com/tillie" class="sister" id="link3">Tillie</a>


You might think that the .next_sibling of the first <a> tag would
be the second <a> tag. But actually, itâs a string: the comma and
newline that separate the first <a> tag from the second:
link = soup.a
link
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>

link.next_sibling
# u',\n'


The second <a> tag is actually the .next_sibling of the comma:
link.next_sibling.next_sibling
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>




.next_siblings and .previous_siblingsÂ¶
You can iterate over a tagâs siblings with .next_siblings or
.previous_siblings:
for sibling in soup.a.next_siblings:
    print(repr(sibling))
# u',\n'
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>
# u' and\n'
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>
# u'; and they lived at the bottom of a well.'
# None

for sibling in soup.find(id="link3").previous_siblings:
    print(repr(sibling))
# ' and\n'
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>
# u',\n'
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>
# u'Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were\n'
# None





Going back and forthÂ¶
Take a look at the beginning of the âthree sistersâ document:
<html><head><title>The Dormouse's story</title></head>
<p class="title"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p>


An HTML parser takes this string of characters and turns it into a
series of events: âopen an <html> tagâ, âopen a <head> tagâ, âopen a
<title> tagâ, âadd a stringâ, âclose the <title> tagâ, âopen a <p>
tagâ, and so on. Beautiful Soup offers tools for reconstructing the
initial parse of the document.

.next_element and .previous_elementÂ¶
The .next_element attribute of a string or tag points to whatever
was parsed immediately afterwards. It might be the same as
.next_sibling, but itâs usually drastically different.
Hereâs the final <a> tag in the âthree sistersâ document. Its
.next_sibling is a string: the conclusion of the sentence that was
interrupted by the start of the <a> tag.:
last_a_tag = soup.find("a", id="link3")
last_a_tag
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>

last_a_tag.next_sibling
# '; and they lived at the bottom of a well.'


But the .next_element of that <a> tag, the thing that was parsed
immediately after the <a> tag, is not the rest of that sentence:
itâs the word âTillieâ:
last_a_tag.next_element
# u'Tillie'


Thatâs because in the original markup, the word âTillieâ appeared
before that semicolon. The parser encountered an <a> tag, then the
word âTillieâ, then the closing </a> tag, then the semicolon and rest of
the sentence. The semicolon is on the same level as the <a> tag, but the
word âTillieâ was encountered first.
The .previous_element attribute is the exact opposite of
.next_element. It points to whatever element was parsed
immediately before this one:
last_a_tag.previous_element
# u' and\n'
last_a_tag.previous_element.next_element
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>




.next_elements and .previous_elementsÂ¶
You should get the idea by now. You can use these iterators to move
forward or backward in the document as it was parsed:
for element in last_a_tag.next_elements:
    print(repr(element))
# u'Tillie'
# u';\nand they lived at the bottom of a well.'
# u'\n\n'
# <p class="story">...</p>
# u'...'
# u'\n'
# None






Searching the treeÂ¶
Beautiful Soup defines a lot of methods for searching the parse tree,
but theyâre all very similar. Iâm going to spend a lot of time explaining
the two most popular methods: find() and find_all(). The other
methods take almost exactly the same arguments, so Iâll just cover
them briefly.
Once again, Iâll be using the âthree sistersâ document as an example:
html_doc = """
<html><head><title>The Dormouse's story</title></head>
<body>
<p class="title"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p>

<p class="story">Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were
<a href="http://example.com/elsie" class="sister" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
<a href="http://example.com/lacie" class="sister" id="link2">Lacie</a> and
<a href="http://example.com/tillie" class="sister" id="link3">Tillie</a>;
and they lived at the bottom of a well.</p>

<p class="story">...</p>
"""

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'html.parser')


By passing in a filter to an argument like find_all(), you can
zoom in on the parts of the document youâre interested in.

Kinds of filtersÂ¶
Before talking in detail about find_all() and similar methods, I
want to show examples of different filters you can pass into these
methods. These filters show up again and again, throughout the
search API. You can use them to filter based on a tagâs name,
on its attributes, on the text of a string, or on some combination of
these.

A stringÂ¶
The simplest filter is a string. Pass a string to a search method and
Beautiful Soup will perform a match against that exact string. This
code finds all the <b> tags in the document:
soup.find_all('b')
# [<b>The Dormouse's story</b>]


If you pass in a byte string, Beautiful Soup will assume the string is
encoded as UTF-8. You can avoid this by passing in a Unicode string instead.


A regular expressionÂ¶
If you pass in a regular expression object, Beautiful Soup will filter
against that regular expression using its search() method. This code
finds all the tags whose names start with the letter âbâ; in this
case, the <body> tag and the <b> tag:
import re
for tag in soup.find_all(re.compile("^b")):
    print(tag.name)
# body
# b


This code finds all the tags whose names contain the letter âtâ:
for tag in soup.find_all(re.compile("t")):
    print(tag.name)
# html
# title




A listÂ¶
If you pass in a list, Beautiful Soup will allow a string match
against any item in that list. This code finds all the <a> tags
and all the <b> tags:
soup.find_all(["a", "b"])
# [<b>The Dormouse's story</b>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]




TrueÂ¶
The value True matches everything it can. This code finds all
the tags in the document, but none of the text strings:
for tag in soup.find_all(True):
    print(tag.name)
# html
# head
# title
# body
# p
# b
# p
# a
# a
# a
# p




A functionÂ¶
If none of the other matches work for you, define a function that
takes an element as its only argument. The function should return
True if the argument matches, and False otherwise.
Hereâs a function that returns True if a tag defines the âclassâ
attribute but doesnât define the âidâ attribute:
def has_class_but_no_id(tag):
    return tag.has_attr('class') and not tag.has_attr('id')


Pass this function into find_all() and youâll pick up all the <p>
tags:
soup.find_all(has_class_but_no_id)
# [<p class="title"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p>,
#  <p class="story">Once upon a time there were...</p>,
#  <p class="story">...</p>]


This function only picks up the <p> tags. It doesnât pick up the <a>
tags, because those tags define both âclassâ and âidâ. It doesnât pick
up tags like <html> and <title>, because those tags donât define
âclassâ.
If you pass in a function to filter on a specific attribute like
href, the argument passed into the function will be the attribute
value, not the whole tag. Hereâs a function that finds all a tags
whose href attribute does not match a regular expression:
def not_lacie(href):
    return href and not re.compile("lacie").search(href)
soup.find_all(href=not_lacie)
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]


The function can be as complicated as you need it to be. Hereâs a
function that returns True if a tag is surrounded by string
objects:
from bs4 import NavigableString
def surrounded_by_strings(tag):
    return (isinstance(tag.next_element, NavigableString)
            and isinstance(tag.previous_element, NavigableString))

for tag in soup.find_all(surrounded_by_strings):
    print tag.name
# p
# a
# a
# a
# p


Now weâre ready to look at the search methods in detail.



find_all()Â¶
Signature: find_all(name, attrs, recursive, string, limit, **kwargs)
The find_all() method looks through a tagâs descendants and
retrieves all descendants that match your filters. I gave several
examples in Kinds of filters, but here are a few more:
soup.find_all("title")
# [<title>The Dormouse's story</title>]

soup.find_all("p", "title")
# [<p class="title"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p>]

soup.find_all("a")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]

soup.find_all(id="link2")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>]

import re
soup.find(string=re.compile("sisters"))
# u'Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were\n'


Some of these should look familiar, but others are new. What does it
mean to pass in a value for string, or id? Why does
find_all("p", "title") find a <p> tag with the CSS class âtitleâ?
Letâs look at the arguments to find_all().

The name argumentÂ¶
Pass in a value for name and youâll tell Beautiful Soup to only
consider tags with certain names. Text strings will be ignored, as
will tags whose names that donât match.
This is the simplest usage:
soup.find_all("title")
# [<title>The Dormouse's story</title>]


Recall from Kinds of filters that the value to name can be a
string, a regular expression, a list, a function, or the value
True.


The keyword argumentsÂ¶
Any argument thatâs not recognized will be turned into a filter on one
of a tagâs attributes. If you pass in a value for an argument called id,
Beautiful Soup will filter against each tagâs âidâ attribute:
soup.find_all(id='link2')
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>]


If you pass in a value for href, Beautiful Soup will filter
against each tagâs âhrefâ attribute:
soup.find_all(href=re.compile("elsie"))
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>]


You can filter an attribute based on a string, a regular
expression, a list, a function, or the value True.
This code finds all tags whose id attribute has a value,
regardless of what the value is:
soup.find_all(id=True)
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]


You can filter multiple attributes at once by passing in more than one
keyword argument:
soup.find_all(href=re.compile("elsie"), id='link1')
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">three</a>]


Some attributes, like the data-* attributes in HTML 5, have names that
canât be used as the names of keyword arguments:
data_soup = BeautifulSoup('<div data-foo="value">foo!</div>')
data_soup.find_all(data-foo="value")
# SyntaxError: keyword can't be an expression


You can use these attributes in searches by putting them into a
dictionary and passing the dictionary into find_all() as the
attrs argument:
data_soup.find_all(attrs={"data-foo": "value"})
# [<div data-foo="value">foo!</div>]


You canât use a keyword argument to search for HTMLâs ânameâ element,
because Beautiful Soup uses the name argument to contain the name
of the tag itself. Instead, you can give a value to ânameâ in the
attrs argument:
name_soup = BeautifulSoup('<input name="email"/>')
name_soup.find_all(name="email")
# []
name_soup.find_all(attrs={"name": "email"})
# [<input name="email"/>]




Searching by CSS classÂ¶
Itâs very useful to search for a tag that has a certain CSS class, but
the name of the CSS attribute, âclassâ, is a reserved word in
Python. Using class as a keyword argument will give you a syntax
error. As of Beautiful Soup 4.1.2, you can search by CSS class using
the keyword argument class_:
soup.find_all("a", class_="sister")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]


As with any keyword argument, you can pass class_ a string, a regular
expression, a function, or True:
soup.find_all(class_=re.compile("itl"))
# [<p class="title"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p>]

def has_six_characters(css_class):
    return css_class is not None and len(css_class) == 6

soup.find_all(class_=has_six_characters)
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]


Remember that a single tag can have multiple
values for its âclassâ attribute. When you search for a tag that
matches a certain CSS class, youâre matching against any of its CSS
classes:
css_soup = BeautifulSoup('<p class="body strikeout"></p>')
css_soup.find_all("p", class_="strikeout")
# [<p class="body strikeout"></p>]

css_soup.find_all("p", class_="body")
# [<p class="body strikeout"></p>]


You can also search for the exact string value of the class attribute:
css_soup.find_all("p", class_="body strikeout")
# [<p class="body strikeout"></p>]


But searching for variants of the string value wonât work:
css_soup.find_all("p", class_="strikeout body")
# []


If you want to search for tags that match two or more CSS classes, you
should use a CSS selector:
css_soup.select("p.strikeout.body")
# [<p class="body strikeout"></p>]


In older versions of Beautiful Soup, which donât have the class_
shortcut, you can use the attrs trick mentioned above. Create a
dictionary whose value for âclassâ is the string (or regular
expression, or whatever) you want to search for:
soup.find_all("a", attrs={"class": "sister"})
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]




The string argumentÂ¶
With string you can search for strings instead of tags. As with
name and the keyword arguments, you can pass in a string, a
regular expression, a list, a function, or the value True.
Here are some examples:
soup.find_all(string="Elsie")
# [u'Elsie']

soup.find_all(string=["Tillie", "Elsie", "Lacie"])
# [u'Elsie', u'Lacie', u'Tillie']

soup.find_all(string=re.compile("Dormouse"))
[u"The Dormouse's story", u"The Dormouse's story"]

def is_the_only_string_within_a_tag(s):
    """Return True if this string is the only child of its parent tag."""
    return (s == s.parent.string)

soup.find_all(string=is_the_only_string_within_a_tag)
# [u"The Dormouse's story", u"The Dormouse's story", u'Elsie', u'Lacie', u'Tillie', u'...']


Although string is for finding strings, you can combine it with
arguments that find tags: Beautiful Soup will find all tags whose
.string matches your value for string. This code finds the <a>
tags whose .string is âElsieâ:
soup.find_all("a", string="Elsie")
# [<a href="http://example.com/elsie" class="sister" id="link1">Elsie</a>]


The string argument is new in Beautiful Soup 4.4.0. In earlier
versions it was called text:
soup.find_all("a", text="Elsie")
# [<a href="http://example.com/elsie" class="sister" id="link1">Elsie</a>]




The limit argumentÂ¶
find_all() returns all the tags and strings that match your
filters. This can take a while if the document is large. If you donât
need all the results, you can pass in a number for limit. This
works just like the LIMIT keyword in SQL. It tells Beautiful Soup to
stop gathering results after itâs found a certain number.
There are three links in the âthree sistersâ document, but this code
only finds the first two:
soup.find_all("a", limit=2)
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>]




The recursive argumentÂ¶
If you call mytag.find_all(), Beautiful Soup will examine all the
descendants of mytag: its children, its childrenâs children, and
so on. If you only want Beautiful Soup to consider direct children,
you can pass in recursive=False. See the difference here:
soup.html.find_all("title")
# [<title>The Dormouse's story</title>]

soup.html.find_all("title", recursive=False)
# []


Hereâs that part of the document:
<html>
 <head>
  <title>
   The Dormouse's story
  </title>
 </head>
...


The <title> tag is beneath the <html> tag, but itâs not directly
beneath the <html> tag: the <head> tag is in the way. Beautiful Soup
finds the <title> tag when itâs allowed to look at all descendants of
the <html> tag, but when recursive=False restricts it to the
<html> tagâs immediate children, it finds nothing.
Beautiful Soup offers a lot of tree-searching methods (covered below),
and they mostly take the same arguments as find_all(): name,
attrs, string, limit, and the keyword arguments. But the
recursive argument is different: find_all() and find() are
the only methods that support it. Passing recursive=False into a
method like find_parents() wouldnât be very useful.



Calling a tag is like calling find_all()Â¶
Because find_all() is the most popular method in the Beautiful
Soup search API, you can use a shortcut for it. If you treat the
BeautifulSoup object or a Tag object as though it were a
function, then itâs the same as calling find_all() on that
object. These two lines of code are equivalent:
soup.find_all("a")
soup("a")


These two lines are also equivalent:
soup.title.find_all(string=True)
soup.title(string=True)




find()Â¶
Signature: find(name, attrs, recursive, string, **kwargs)
The find_all() method scans the entire document looking for
results, but sometimes you only want to find one result. If you know a
document only has one <body> tag, itâs a waste of time to scan the
entire document looking for more. Rather than passing in limit=1
every time you call find_all, you can use the find()
method. These two lines of code are nearly equivalent:
soup.find_all('title', limit=1)
# [<title>The Dormouse's story</title>]

soup.find('title')
# <title>The Dormouse's story</title>


The only difference is that find_all() returns a list containing
the single result, and find() just returns the result.
If find_all() canât find anything, it returns an empty list. If
find() canât find anything, it returns None:
print(soup.find("nosuchtag"))
# None


Remember the soup.head.title trick from Navigating using tag
names? That trick works by repeatedly calling find():
soup.head.title
# <title>The Dormouse's story</title>

soup.find("head").find("title")
# <title>The Dormouse's story</title>




find_parents() and find_parent()Â¶
Signature: find_parents(name, attrs, string, limit, **kwargs)
Signature: find_parent(name, attrs, string, **kwargs)
I spent a lot of time above covering find_all() and
find(). The Beautiful Soup API defines ten other methods for
searching the tree, but donât be afraid. Five of these methods are
basically the same as find_all(), and the other five are basically
the same as find(). The only differences are in what parts of the
tree they search.
First letâs consider find_parents() and
find_parent(). Remember that find_all() and find() work
their way down the tree, looking at tagâs descendants. These methods
do the opposite: they work their way up the tree, looking at a tagâs
(or a stringâs) parents. Letâs try them out, starting from a string
buried deep in the âthree daughtersâ document:
a_string = soup.find(string="Lacie")
a_string
# u'Lacie'

a_string.find_parents("a")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>]

a_string.find_parent("p")
# <p class="story">Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a> and
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>;
#  and they lived at the bottom of a well.</p>

a_string.find_parents("p", class="title")
# []


One of the three <a> tags is the direct parent of the string in
question, so our search finds it. One of the three <p> tags is an
indirect parent of the string, and our search finds that as
well. Thereâs a <p> tag with the CSS class âtitleâ somewhere in the
document, but itâs not one of this stringâs parents, so we canât find
it with find_parents().
You may have made the connection between find_parent() and
find_parents(), and the .parent and .parents attributes
mentioned earlier. The connection is very strong. These search methods
actually use .parents to iterate over all the parents, and check
each one against the provided filter to see if it matches.


find_next_siblings() and find_next_sibling()Â¶
Signature: find_next_siblings(name, attrs, string, limit, **kwargs)
Signature: find_next_sibling(name, attrs, string, **kwargs)
These methods use .next_siblings to
iterate over the rest of an elementâs siblings in the tree. The
find_next_siblings() method returns all the siblings that match,
and find_next_sibling() only returns the first one:
first_link = soup.a
first_link
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>

first_link.find_next_siblings("a")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]

first_story_paragraph = soup.find("p", "story")
first_story_paragraph.find_next_sibling("p")
# <p class="story">...</p>




find_previous_siblings() and find_previous_sibling()Â¶
Signature: find_previous_siblings(name, attrs, string, limit, **kwargs)
Signature: find_previous_sibling(name, attrs, string, **kwargs)
These methods use .previous_siblings to iterate over an elementâs
siblings that precede it in the tree. The find_previous_siblings()
method returns all the siblings that match, and
find_previous_sibling() only returns the first one:
last_link = soup.find("a", id="link3")
last_link
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>

last_link.find_previous_siblings("a")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>]

first_story_paragraph = soup.find("p", "story")
first_story_paragraph.find_previous_sibling("p")
# <p class="title"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p>




find_all_next() and find_next()Â¶
Signature: find_all_next(name, attrs, string, limit, **kwargs)
Signature: find_next(name, attrs, string, **kwargs)
These methods use .next_elements to
iterate over whatever tags and strings that come after it in the
document. The find_all_next() method returns all matches, and
find_next() only returns the first match:
first_link = soup.a
first_link
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>

first_link.find_all_next(string=True)
# [u'Elsie', u',\n', u'Lacie', u' and\n', u'Tillie',
#  u';\nand they lived at the bottom of a well.', u'\n\n', u'...', u'\n']

first_link.find_next("p")
# <p class="story">...</p>


In the first example, the string âElsieâ showed up, even though it was
contained within the <a> tag we started from. In the second example,
the last <p> tag in the document showed up, even though itâs not in
the same part of the tree as the <a> tag we started from. For these
methods, all that matters is that an element match the filter, and
show up later in the document than the starting element.


find_all_previous() and find_previous()Â¶
Signature: find_all_previous(name, attrs, string, limit, **kwargs)
Signature: find_previous(name, attrs, string, **kwargs)
These methods use .previous_elements to
iterate over the tags and strings that came before it in the
document. The find_all_previous() method returns all matches, and
find_previous() only returns the first match:
first_link = soup.a
first_link
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>

first_link.find_all_previous("p")
# [<p class="story">Once upon a time there were three little sisters; ...</p>,
#  <p class="title"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p>]

first_link.find_previous("title")
# <title>The Dormouse's story</title>


The call to find_all_previous("p") found the first paragraph in
the document (the one with class=âtitleâ), but it also finds the
second paragraph, the <p> tag that contains the <a> tag we started
with. This shouldnât be too surprising: weâre looking at all the tags
that show up earlier in the document than the one we started with. A
<p> tag that contains an <a> tag must have shown up before the <a>
tag it contains.


CSS selectorsÂ¶
As of version 4.7.0, Beautiful Soup supports most CSS4 selectors via
the SoupSieve
project. If you installed Beautiful Soup through pip, SoupSieve
was installed at the same time, so you donât have to do anything extra.
BeautifulSoup has a .select() method which uses SoupSieve to
run a CSS selector against a parsed document and return all the
matching elements. Tag has a similar method which runs a CSS
selector against the contents of a single tag.
(Earlier versions of Beautiful Soup also have the .select()
method, but only the most commonly-used CSS selectors are supported.)
The SoupSieve documentation lists all the currently
supported CSS selectors, but here are some of the basics:
You can find tags:
soup.select("title")
# [<title>The Dormouse's story</title>]

soup.select("p:nth-of-type(3)")
# [<p class="story">...</p>]


Find tags beneath other tags:
soup.select("body a")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie"  id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]

soup.select("html head title")
# [<title>The Dormouse's story</title>]


Find tags directly beneath other tags:
soup.select("head > title")
# [<title>The Dormouse's story</title>]

soup.select("p > a")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie"  id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]

soup.select("p > a:nth-of-type(2)")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>]

soup.select("p > #link1")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>]

soup.select("body > a")
# []


Find the siblings of tags:
soup.select("#link1 ~ .sister")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie"  id="link3">Tillie</a>]

soup.select("#link1 + .sister")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>]


Find tags by CSS class:
soup.select(".sister")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]

soup.select("[class~=sister]")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]


Find tags by ID:
soup.select("#link1")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>]

soup.select("a#link2")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>]


Find tags that match any selector from a list of selectors:
soup.select("#link1,#link2")
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>]


Test for the existence of an attribute:
soup.select('a[href]')
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]


Find tags by attribute value:
soup.select('a[href="http://example.com/elsie"]')
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>]

soup.select('a[href^="http://example.com/"]')
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">Lacie</a>,
#  <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]

soup.select('a[href$="tillie"]')
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">Tillie</a>]

soup.select('a[href*=".com/el"]')
# [<a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>]


Thereâs also a method called select_one(), which finds only the
first tag that matches a selector:
soup.select_one(".sister")
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">Elsie</a>


If youâve parsed XML that defines namespaces, you can use them in CSS
selectors.:
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
xml = """<tag xmlns:ns1="http://namespace1/" xmlns:ns2="http://namespace2/">
 <ns1:child>I'm in namespace 1</ns1:child>
 <ns2:child>I'm in namespace 2</ns2:child>
</tag> """
soup = BeautifulSoup(xml, "xml")

soup.select("child")
# [<ns1:child>I'm in namespace 1</ns1:child>, <ns2:child>I'm in namespace 2</ns2:child>]

soup.select("ns1|child", namespaces=namespaces)
# [<ns1:child>I'm in namespace 1</ns1:child>]


When handling a CSS selector that uses namespaces, Beautiful Soup
uses the namespace abbreviations it found when parsing the
document. You can override this by passing in your own dictionary of
abbreviations:
namespaces = dict(first="http://namespace1/", second="http://namespace2/")
soup.select("second|child", namespaces=namespaces)
# [<ns1:child>I'm in namespace 2</ns1:child>]


All this CSS selector stuff is a convenience for people who already
know the CSS selector syntax. You can do all of this with the
Beautiful Soup API. And if CSS selectors are all you need, you should
parse the document with lxml: itâs a lot faster. But this lets you
combine CSS selectors with the Beautiful Soup API.



Modifying the treeÂ¶
Beautiful Soupâs main strength is in searching the parse tree, but you
can also modify the tree and write your changes as a new HTML or XML
document.

Changing tag names and attributesÂ¶
I covered this earlier, in Attributes, but it bears repeating. You
can rename a tag, change the values of its attributes, add new
attributes, and delete attributes:
soup = BeautifulSoup('<b class="boldest">Extremely bold</b>')
tag = soup.b

tag.name = "blockquote"
tag['class'] = 'verybold'
tag['id'] = 1
tag
# <blockquote class="verybold" id="1">Extremely bold</blockquote>

del tag['class']
del tag['id']
tag
# <blockquote>Extremely bold</blockquote>




Modifying .stringÂ¶
If you set a tagâs .string attribute to a new string, the tagâs contents are
replaced with that string:
markup = '<a href="http://example.com/">I linked to <i>example.com</i></a>'
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup)

tag = soup.a
tag.string = "New link text."
tag
# <a href="http://example.com/">New link text.</a>


Be careful: if the tag contained other tags, they and all their
contents will be destroyed.


append()Â¶
You can add to a tagâs contents with Tag.append(). It works just
like calling .append() on a Python list:
soup = BeautifulSoup("<a>Foo</a>")
soup.a.append("Bar")

soup
# <html><head></head><body><a>FooBar</a></body></html>
soup.a.contents
# [u'Foo', u'Bar']




extend()Â¶
Starting in Beautiful Soup 4.7.0, Tag also supports a method
called .extend(), which works just like calling .extend() on a
Python list:
soup = BeautifulSoup("<a>Soup</a>")
soup.a.extend(["'s", " ", "on"])

soup
# <html><head></head><body><a>Soup's on</a></body></html>
soup.a.contents
# [u'Soup', u''s', u' ', u'on']




NavigableString() and .new_tag()Â¶
If you need to add a string to a document, no problemâyou can pass a
Python string in to append(), or you can call the NavigableString
constructor:
soup = BeautifulSoup("<b></b>")
tag = soup.b
tag.append("Hello")
new_string = NavigableString(" there")
tag.append(new_string)
tag
# <b>Hello there.</b>
tag.contents
# [u'Hello', u' there']


If you want to create a comment or some other subclass of
NavigableString, just call the constructor:
from bs4 import Comment
new_comment = Comment("Nice to see you.")
tag.append(new_comment)
tag
# <b>Hello there<!--Nice to see you.--></b>
tag.contents
# [u'Hello', u' there', u'Nice to see you.']


(This is a new feature in Beautiful Soup 4.4.0.)
What if you need to create a whole new tag?  The best solution is to
call the factory method BeautifulSoup.new_tag():
soup = BeautifulSoup("<b></b>")
original_tag = soup.b

new_tag = soup.new_tag("a", href="http://www.example.com")
original_tag.append(new_tag)
original_tag
# <b><a href="http://www.example.com"></a></b>

new_tag.string = "Link text."
original_tag
# <b><a href="http://www.example.com">Link text.</a></b>


Only the first argument, the tag name, is required.


insert()Â¶
Tag.insert() is just like Tag.append(), except the new element
doesnât necessarily go at the end of its parentâs
.contents. Itâll be inserted at whatever numeric position you
say. It works just like .insert() on a Python list:
markup = '<a href="http://example.com/">I linked to <i>example.com</i></a>'
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup)
tag = soup.a

tag.insert(1, "but did not endorse ")
tag
# <a href="http://example.com/">I linked to but did not endorse <i>example.com</i></a>
tag.contents
# [u'I linked to ', u'but did not endorse', <i>example.com</i>]




insert_before() and insert_after()Â¶
The insert_before() method inserts tags or strings immediately
before something else in the parse tree:
soup = BeautifulSoup("<b>stop</b>")
tag = soup.new_tag("i")
tag.string = "Don't"
soup.b.string.insert_before(tag)
soup.b
# <b><i>Don't</i>stop</b>


The insert_after() method inserts tags or strings immediately
following something else in the parse tree:
div = soup.new_tag('div')
div.string = 'ever'
soup.b.i.insert_after(" you ", div)
soup.b
# <b><i>Don't</i> you <div>ever</div> stop</b>
soup.b.contents
# [<i>Don't</i>, u' you', <div>ever</div>, u'stop']




clear()Â¶
Tag.clear() removes the contents of a tag:
markup = '<a href="http://example.com/">I linked to <i>example.com</i></a>'
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup)
tag = soup.a

tag.clear()
tag
# <a href="http://example.com/"></a>




extract()Â¶
PageElement.extract() removes a tag or string from the tree. It
returns the tag or string that was extracted:
markup = '<a href="http://example.com/">I linked to <i>example.com</i></a>'
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup)
a_tag = soup.a

i_tag = soup.i.extract()

a_tag
# <a href="http://example.com/">I linked to</a>

i_tag
# <i>example.com</i>

print(i_tag.parent)
None


At this point you effectively have two parse trees: one rooted at the
BeautifulSoup object you used to parse the document, and one rooted
at the tag that was extracted. You can go on to call extract on
a child of the element you extracted:
my_string = i_tag.string.extract()
my_string
# u'example.com'

print(my_string.parent)
# None
i_tag
# <i></i>




decompose()Â¶
Tag.decompose() removes a tag from the tree, then completely
destroys it and its contents:
markup = '<a href="http://example.com/">I linked to <i>example.com</i></a>'
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup)
a_tag = soup.a

soup.i.decompose()

a_tag
# <a href="http://example.com/">I linked to</a>




replace_with()Â¶
PageElement.replace_with() removes a tag or string from the tree,
and replaces it with the tag or string of your choice:
markup = '<a href="http://example.com/">I linked to <i>example.com</i></a>'
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup)
a_tag = soup.a

new_tag = soup.new_tag("b")
new_tag.string = "example.net"
a_tag.i.replace_with(new_tag)

a_tag
# <a href="http://example.com/">I linked to <b>example.net</b></a>


replace_with() returns the tag or string that was replaced, so
that you can examine it or add it back to another part of the tree.


wrap()Â¶
PageElement.wrap() wraps an element in the tag you specify. It
returns the new wrapper:
soup = BeautifulSoup("<p>I wish I was bold.</p>")
soup.p.string.wrap(soup.new_tag("b"))
# <b>I wish I was bold.</b>

soup.p.wrap(soup.new_tag("div")
# <div><p><b>I wish I was bold.</b></p></div>


This method is new in Beautiful Soup 4.0.5.


unwrap()Â¶
Tag.unwrap() is the opposite of wrap(). It replaces a tag with
whateverâs inside that tag. Itâs good for stripping out markup:
markup = '<a href="http://example.com/">I linked to <i>example.com</i></a>'
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup)
a_tag = soup.a

a_tag.i.unwrap()
a_tag
# <a href="http://example.com/">I linked to example.com</a>


Like replace_with(), unwrap() returns the tag
that was replaced.


smooth()Â¶
After calling a bunch of methods that modify the parse tree, you may end up with two or more NavigableString objects next to each other. Beautiful Soup doesnât have any problems with this, but since it canât happen in a freshly parsed document, you might not expect behavior like the following:
soup = BeautifulSoup("<p>A one</p>")
soup.p.append(", a two")

soup.p.contents
# [u'A one', u', a two']

print(soup.p.encode())
# <p>A one, a two</p>

print(soup.p.prettify())
# <p>
#  A one
#  , a two
# </p>


You can call Tag.smooth() to clean up the parse tree by consolidating adjacent strings:
soup.smooth()

soup.p.contents
# [u'A one, a two']

print(soup.p.prettify())
# <p>
#  A one, a two
# </p>


The smooth() method is new in Beautiful Soup 4.8.0.



OutputÂ¶

Pretty-printingÂ¶
The prettify() method will turn a Beautiful Soup parse tree into a
nicely formatted Unicode string, with a separate line for each
tag and each string:
markup = '<a href="http://example.com/">I linked to <i>example.com</i></a>'
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup)
soup.prettify()
# '<html>\n <head>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <a href="http://example.com/">\n...'

print(soup.prettify())
# <html>
#  <head>
#  </head>
#  <body>
#   <a href="http://example.com/">
#    I linked to
#    <i>
#     example.com
#    </i>
#   </a>
#  </body>
# </html>


You can call prettify() on the top-level BeautifulSoup object,
or on any of its Tag objects:
print(soup.a.prettify())
# <a href="http://example.com/">
#  I linked to
#  <i>
#   example.com
#  </i>
# </a>




Non-pretty printingÂ¶
If you just want a string, with no fancy formatting, you can call
unicode() or str() on a BeautifulSoup object, or a Tag
within it:
str(soup)
# '<html><head></head><body><a href="http://example.com/">I linked to <i>example.com</i></a></body></html>'

unicode(soup.a)
# u'<a href="http://example.com/">I linked to <i>example.com</i></a>'


The str() function returns a string encoded in UTF-8. See
Encodings for other options.
You can also call encode() to get a bytestring, and decode()
to get Unicode.


Output formattersÂ¶
If you give Beautiful Soup a document that contains HTML entities like
â&lquot;â, theyâll be converted to Unicode characters:
soup = BeautifulSoup("&ldquo;Dammit!&rdquo; he said.")
unicode(soup)
# u'<html><head></head><body>\u201cDammit!\u201d he said.</body></html>'


If you then convert the document to a string, the Unicode characters
will be encoded as UTF-8. You wonât get the HTML entities back:
str(soup)
# '<html><head></head><body>\xe2\x80\x9cDammit!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</body></html>'


By default, the only characters that are escaped upon output are bare
ampersands and angle brackets. These get turned into â&amp;â, â&lt;â,
and â&gt;â, so that Beautiful Soup doesnât inadvertently generate
invalid HTML or XML:
soup = BeautifulSoup("<p>The law firm of Dewey, Cheatem, & Howe</p>")
soup.p
# <p>The law firm of Dewey, Cheatem, &amp; Howe</p>

soup = BeautifulSoup('<a href="http://example.com/?foo=val1&bar=val2">A link</a>')
soup.a
# <a href="http://example.com/?foo=val1&amp;bar=val2">A link</a>


You can change this behavior by providing a value for the
formatter argument to prettify(), encode(), or
decode(). Beautiful Soup recognizes five possible values for
formatter.
The default is formatter="minimal". Strings will only be processed
enough to ensure that Beautiful Soup generates valid HTML/XML:
french = "<p>Il a dit &lt;&lt;Sacr&eacute; bleu!&gt;&gt;</p>"
soup = BeautifulSoup(french)
print(soup.prettify(formatter="minimal"))
# <html>
#  <body>
#   <p>
#    Il a dit &lt;&lt;SacrÃ© bleu!&gt;&gt;
#   </p>
#  </body>
# </html>


If you pass in formatter="html", Beautiful Soup will convert
Unicode characters to HTML entities whenever possible:
print(soup.prettify(formatter="html"))
# <html>
#  <body>
#   <p>
#    Il a dit &lt;&lt;Sacr&eacute; bleu!&gt;&gt;
#   </p>
#  </body>
# </html>


If you pass in formatter="html5", itâs the same as
formatter="html5", but Beautiful Soup will
omit the closing slash in HTML void tags like âbrâ:
soup = BeautifulSoup("<br>")

print(soup.encode(formatter="html"))
# <html><body><br/></body></html>

print(soup.encode(formatter="html5"))
# <html><body><br></body></html>


If you pass in formatter=None, Beautiful Soup will not modify
strings at all on output. This is the fastest option, but it may lead
to Beautiful Soup generating invalid HTML/XML, as in these examples:
print(soup.prettify(formatter=None))
# <html>
#  <body>
#   <p>
#    Il a dit <<SacrÃ© bleu!>>
#   </p>
#  </body>
# </html>

link_soup = BeautifulSoup('<a href="http://example.com/?foo=val1&bar=val2">A link</a>')
print(link_soup.a.encode(formatter=None))
# <a href="http://example.com/?foo=val1&bar=val2">A link</a>


If you need more sophisticated control over your output, you can
use Beautiful Soupâs Formatter class. Hereâs a formatter that
converts strings to uppercase, whether they occur in a text node or in an
attribute value:
from bs4.formatter import HTMLFormatter
def uppercase(str):
    return str.upper()
formatter = HTMLFormatter(uppercase)

print(soup.prettify(formatter=formatter))
# <html>
#  <body>
#   <p>
#    IL A DIT <<SACRÃ BLEU!>>
#   </p>
#  </body>
# </html>

print(link_soup.a.prettify(formatter=formatter))
# <a href="HTTP://EXAMPLE.COM/?FOO=VAL1&BAR=VAL2">
#  A LINK
# </a>


Subclassing HTMLFormatter or XMLFormatter will give you even
more control over the output. For example, Beautiful Soup sorts the
attributes in every tag by default:
attr_soup = BeautifulSoup(b'<p z="1" m="2" a="3"></p>')
print(attr_soup.p.encode())
# <p a="3" m="2" z="1"></p>


To turn this off, you can subclass the Formatter.attributes()
method, which controls which attributes are output and in what
order. This implementation also filters out the attribute called âmâ
whenever it appears:
class UnsortedAttributes(HTMLFormatter):
    def attributes(self, tag):
        for k, v in tag.attrs.items():
            if k == 'm':
                continue
            yield k, v
print(attr_soup.p.encode(formatter=UnsortedAttributes()))
# <p z="1" a="3"></p>


One last caveat: if you create a CData object, the text inside
that object is always presented exactly as it appears, with no
formatting. Beautiful Soup will call your entity substitution
function, just in case youâve written a custom function that counts
all the strings in the document or something, but it will ignore the
return value:
from bs4.element import CData
soup = BeautifulSoup("<a></a>")
soup.a.string = CData("one < three")
print(soup.a.prettify(formatter="xml"))
# <a>
#  <![CDATA[one < three]]>
# </a>




get_text()Â¶
If you only want the text part of a document or tag, you can use the
get_text() method. It returns all the text in a document or
beneath a tag, as a single Unicode string:
markup = '<a href="http://example.com/">\nI linked to <i>example.com</i>\n</a>'
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup)

soup.get_text()
u'\nI linked to example.com\n'
soup.i.get_text()
u'example.com'


You can specify a string to be used to join the bits of text
together:
# soup.get_text("|")
u'\nI linked to |example.com|\n'


You can tell Beautiful Soup to strip whitespace from the beginning and
end of each bit of text:
# soup.get_text("|", strip=True)
u'I linked to|example.com'


But at that point you might want to use the .stripped_strings
generator instead, and process the text yourself:
[text for text in soup.stripped_strings]
# [u'I linked to', u'example.com']





Specifying the parser to useÂ¶
If you just need to parse some HTML, you can dump the markup into the
BeautifulSoup constructor, and itâll probably be fine. Beautiful
Soup will pick a parser for you and parse the data. But there are a
few additional arguments you can pass in to the constructor to change
which parser is used.
The first argument to the BeautifulSoup constructor is a string or
an open filehandleâthe markup you want parsed. The second argument is
how youâd like the markup parsed.
If you donât specify anything, youâll get the best HTML parser thatâs
installed. Beautiful Soup ranks lxmlâs parser as being the best, then
html5libâs, then Pythonâs built-in parser. You can override this by
specifying one of the following:

What type of markup you want to parse. Currently supported are
âhtmlâ, âxmlâ, and âhtml5â.
The name of the parser library you want to use. Currently supported
options are âlxmlâ, âhtml5libâ, and âhtml.parserâ (Pythonâs
built-in HTML parser).

The section Installing a parser contrasts the supported parsers.
If you donât have an appropriate parser installed, Beautiful Soup will
ignore your request and pick a different parser. Right now, the only
supported XML parser is lxml. If you donât have lxml installed, asking
for an XML parser wonât give you one, and asking for âlxmlâ wonât work
either.

Differences between parsersÂ¶
Beautiful Soup presents the same interface to a number of different
parsers, but each parser is different. Different parsers will create
different parse trees from the same document. The biggest differences
are between the HTML parsers and the XML parsers. Hereâs a short
document, parsed as HTML:
BeautifulSoup("<a><b /></a>")
# <html><head></head><body><a><b></b></a></body></html>


Since an empty <b /> tag is not valid HTML, the parser turns it into a
<b></b> tag pair.
Hereâs the same document parsed as XML (running this requires that you
have lxml installed). Note that the empty <b /> tag is left alone, and
that the document is given an XML declaration instead of being put
into an <html> tag.:
BeautifulSoup("<a><b /></a>", "xml")
# <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
# <a><b/></a>


There are also differences between HTML parsers. If you give Beautiful
Soup a perfectly-formed HTML document, these differences wonât
matter. One parser will be faster than another, but theyâll all give
you a data structure that looks exactly like the original HTML
document.
But if the document is not perfectly-formed, different parsers will
give different results. Hereâs a short, invalid document parsed using
lxmlâs HTML parser. Note that the dangling </p> tag is simply
ignored:
BeautifulSoup("<a></p>", "lxml")
# <html><body><a></a></body></html>


Hereâs the same document parsed using html5lib:
BeautifulSoup("<a></p>", "html5lib")
# <html><head></head><body><a><p></p></a></body></html>


Instead of ignoring the dangling </p> tag, html5lib pairs it with an
opening <p> tag. This parser also adds an empty <head> tag to the
document.
Hereâs the same document parsed with Pythonâs built-in HTML
parser:
BeautifulSoup("<a></p>", "html.parser")
# <a></a>


Like html5lib, this parser ignores the closing </p> tag. Unlike
html5lib, this parser makes no attempt to create a well-formed HTML
document by adding a <body> tag. Unlike lxml, it doesnât even bother
to add an <html> tag.
Since the document â<a></p>â is invalid, none of these techniques is
the âcorrectâ way to handle it. The html5lib parser uses techniques
that are part of the HTML5 standard, so it has the best claim on being
the âcorrectâ way, but all three techniques are legitimate.
Differences between parsers can affect your script. If youâre planning
on distributing your script to other people, or running it on multiple
machines, you should specify a parser in the BeautifulSoup
constructor. That will reduce the chances that your users parse a
document differently from the way you parse it.



EncodingsÂ¶
Any HTML or XML document is written in a specific encoding like ASCII
or UTF-8.  But when you load that document into Beautiful Soup, youâll
discover itâs been converted to Unicode:
markup = "<h1>Sacr\xc3\xa9 bleu!</h1>"
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup)
soup.h1
# <h1>SacrÃ© bleu!</h1>
soup.h1.string
# u'Sacr\xe9 bleu!'


Itâs not magic. (That sure would be nice.) Beautiful Soup uses a
sub-library called Unicode, Dammit to detect a documentâs encoding
and convert it to Unicode. The autodetected encoding is available as
the .original_encoding attribute of the BeautifulSoup object:
soup.original_encoding
'utf-8'


Unicode, Dammit guesses correctly most of the time, but sometimes it
makes mistakes. Sometimes it guesses correctly, but only after a
byte-by-byte search of the document that takes a very long time. If
you happen to know a documentâs encoding ahead of time, you can avoid
mistakes and delays by passing it to the BeautifulSoup constructor
as from_encoding.
Hereâs a document written in ISO-8859-8. The document is so short that
Unicode, Dammit canât get a lock on it, and misidentifies it as
ISO-8859-7:
markup = b"<h1>\xed\xe5\xec\xf9</h1>"
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup)
soup.h1
<h1>Î½ÎµÎ¼Ï</h1>
soup.original_encoding
'ISO-8859-7'


We can fix this by passing in the correct from_encoding:
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup, from_encoding="iso-8859-8")
soup.h1
<h1>××××©</h1>
soup.original_encoding
'iso8859-8'


If you donât know what the correct encoding is, but you know that
Unicode, Dammit is guessing wrong, you can pass the wrong guesses in
as exclude_encodings:
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup, exclude_encodings=["ISO-8859-7"])
soup.h1
<h1>××××©</h1>
soup.original_encoding
'WINDOWS-1255'


Windows-1255 isnât 100% correct, but that encoding is a compatible
superset of ISO-8859-8, so itâs close enough. (exclude_encodings
is a new feature in Beautiful Soup 4.4.0.)
In rare cases (usually when a UTF-8 document contains text written in
a completely different encoding), the only way to get Unicode may be
to replace some characters with the special Unicode character
âREPLACEMENT CHARACTERâ (U+FFFD, ï¿½). If Unicode, Dammit needs to do
this, it will set the .contains_replacement_characters attribute
to True on the UnicodeDammit or BeautifulSoup object. This
lets you know that the Unicode representation is not an exact
representation of the originalâsome data was lost. If a document
contains ï¿½, but .contains_replacement_characters is False,
youâll know that the ï¿½ was there originally (as it is in this
paragraph) and doesnât stand in for missing data.

Output encodingÂ¶
When you write out a document from Beautiful Soup, you get a UTF-8
document, even if the document wasnât in UTF-8 to begin with. Hereâs a
document written in the Latin-1 encoding:
markup = b'''
 <html>
  <head>
   <meta content="text/html; charset=ISO-Latin-1" http-equiv="Content-type" />
  </head>
  <body>
   <p>Sacr\xe9 bleu!</p>
  </body>
 </html>
'''

soup = BeautifulSoup(markup)
print(soup.prettify())
# <html>
#  <head>
#   <meta content="text/html; charset=utf-8" http-equiv="Content-type" />
#  </head>
#  <body>
#   <p>
#    SacrÃ© bleu!
#   </p>
#  </body>
# </html>


Note that the <meta> tag has been rewritten to reflect the fact that
the document is now in UTF-8.
If you donât want UTF-8, you can pass an encoding into prettify():
print(soup.prettify("latin-1"))
# <html>
#  <head>
#   <meta content="text/html; charset=latin-1" http-equiv="Content-type" />
# ...


You can also call encode() on the BeautifulSoup object, or any
element in the soup, just as if it were a Python string:
soup.p.encode("latin-1")
# '<p>Sacr\xe9 bleu!</p>'

soup.p.encode("utf-8")
# '<p>Sacr\xc3\xa9 bleu!</p>'


Any characters that canât be represented in your chosen encoding will
be converted into numeric XML entity references. Hereâs a document
that includes the Unicode character SNOWMAN:
markup = u"<b>\N{SNOWMAN}</b>"
snowman_soup = BeautifulSoup(markup)
tag = snowman_soup.b


The SNOWMAN character can be part of a UTF-8 document (it looks like
â), but thereâs no representation for that character in ISO-Latin-1 or
ASCII, so itâs converted into â&#9731â for those encodings:
print(tag.encode("utf-8"))
# <b>â</b>

print tag.encode("latin-1")
# <b>&#9731;</b>

print tag.encode("ascii")
# <b>&#9731;</b>




Unicode, DammitÂ¶
You can use Unicode, Dammit without using Beautiful Soup. Itâs useful
whenever you have data in an unknown encoding and you just want it to
become Unicode:
from bs4 import UnicodeDammit
dammit = UnicodeDammit("Sacr\xc3\xa9 bleu!")
print(dammit.unicode_markup)
# SacrÃ© bleu!
dammit.original_encoding
# 'utf-8'


Unicode, Dammitâs guesses will get a lot more accurate if you install
the chardet or cchardet Python libraries. The more data you
give Unicode, Dammit, the more accurately it will guess. If you have
your own suspicions as to what the encoding might be, you can pass
them in as a list:
dammit = UnicodeDammit("Sacr\xe9 bleu!", ["latin-1", "iso-8859-1"])
print(dammit.unicode_markup)
# SacrÃ© bleu!
dammit.original_encoding
# 'latin-1'


Unicode, Dammit has two special features that Beautiful Soup doesnât
use.

Smart quotesÂ¶
You can use Unicode, Dammit to convert Microsoft smart quotes to HTML or XML
entities:
markup = b"<p>I just \x93love\x94 Microsoft Word\x92s smart quotes</p>"

UnicodeDammit(markup, ["windows-1252"], smart_quotes_to="html").unicode_markup
# u'<p>I just &ldquo;love&rdquo; Microsoft Word&rsquo;s smart quotes</p>'

UnicodeDammit(markup, ["windows-1252"], smart_quotes_to="xml").unicode_markup
# u'<p>I just &#x201C;love&#x201D; Microsoft Word&#x2019;s smart quotes</p>'


You can also convert Microsoft smart quotes to ASCII quotes:
UnicodeDammit(markup, ["windows-1252"], smart_quotes_to="ascii").unicode_markup
# u'<p>I just "love" Microsoft Word\'s smart quotes</p>'


Hopefully youâll find this feature useful, but Beautiful Soup doesnât
use it. Beautiful Soup prefers the default behavior, which is to
convert Microsoft smart quotes to Unicode characters along with
everything else:
UnicodeDammit(markup, ["windows-1252"]).unicode_markup
# u'<p>I just \u201clove\u201d Microsoft Word\u2019s smart quotes</p>'




Inconsistent encodingsÂ¶
Sometimes a document is mostly in UTF-8, but contains Windows-1252
characters such as (again) Microsoft smart quotes. This can happen
when a website includes data from multiple sources. You can use
UnicodeDammit.detwingle() to turn such a document into pure
UTF-8. Hereâs a simple example:
snowmen = (u"\N{SNOWMAN}" * 3)
quote = (u"\N{LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK}I like snowmen!\N{RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK}")
doc = snowmen.encode("utf8") + quote.encode("windows_1252")


This document is a mess. The snowmen are in UTF-8 and the quotes are
in Windows-1252. You can display the snowmen or the quotes, but not
both:
print(doc)
# âââï¿½I like snowmen!ï¿½

print(doc.decode("windows-1252"))
# Ã¢ËÆÃ¢ËÆÃ¢ËÆâI like snowmen!â


Decoding the document as UTF-8 raises a UnicodeDecodeError, and
decoding it as Windows-1252 gives you gibberish. Fortunately,
UnicodeDammit.detwingle() will convert the string to pure UTF-8,
allowing you to decode it to Unicode and display the snowmen and quote
marks simultaneously:
new_doc = UnicodeDammit.detwingle(doc)
print(new_doc.decode("utf8"))
# ââââI like snowmen!â


UnicodeDammit.detwingle() only knows how to handle Windows-1252
embedded in UTF-8 (or vice versa, I suppose), but this is the most
common case.
Note that you must know to call UnicodeDammit.detwingle() on your
data before passing it into BeautifulSoup or the UnicodeDammit
constructor. Beautiful Soup assumes that a document has a single
encoding, whatever it might be. If you pass it a document that
contains both UTF-8 and Windows-1252, itâs likely to think the whole
document is Windows-1252, and the document will come out looking like
Ã¢ËÆÃ¢ËÆÃ¢ËÆâI like snowmen!â.
UnicodeDammit.detwingle() is new in Beautiful Soup 4.1.0.




Line numbersÂ¶
The html.parser` and ``html5lib parsers can keep track of where in
the original document each Tag was found. You can access this
information as Tag.sourceline (line number) and Tag.sourcepos
(position of the start tag within a line):
markup = "<p\n>Paragraph 1</p>\n    <p>Paragraph 2</p>"
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup, 'html.parser')
for tag in soup.find_all('p'):
    print(tag.sourceline, tag.sourcepos, tag.string)
# (1, 0, u'Paragraph 1')
# (2, 3, u'Paragraph 2')


Note that the two parsers mean slightly different things by
sourceline and sourcepos. For html.parser, these numbers
represent the position of the initial less-than sign. For html5lib,
these numbers represent the position of the final greater-than sign:
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup, 'html5lib')
for tag in soup.find_all('p'):
    print(tag.sourceline, tag.sourcepos, tag.string)
# (2, 1, u'Paragraph 1')
# (3, 7, u'Paragraph 2')


You can shut off this feature by passing store_line_numbers=False`
into the ``BeautifulSoup constructor:
markup = "<p\n>Paragraph 1</p>\n    <p>Paragraph 2</p>"
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup, 'html.parser', store_line_numbers=False)
soup.p.sourceline
# None


This feature is new in 4.8.1, and the parsers based on lxml donât
support it.


Comparing objects for equalityÂ¶
Beautiful Soup says that two NavigableString or Tag objects
are equal when they represent the same HTML or XML markup. In this
example, the two <b> tags are treated as equal, even though they live
in different parts of the object tree, because they both look like
â<b>pizza</b>â:
markup = "<p>I want <b>pizza</b> and more <b>pizza</b>!</p>"
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup, 'html.parser')
first_b, second_b = soup.find_all('b')
print first_b == second_b
# True

print first_b.previous_element == second_b.previous_element
# False


If you want to see whether two variables refer to exactly the same
object, use is:
print first_b is second_b
# False




Copying Beautiful Soup objectsÂ¶
You can use copy.copy() to create a copy of any Tag or
NavigableString:
import copy
p_copy = copy.copy(soup.p)
print p_copy
# <p>I want <b>pizza</b> and more <b>pizza</b>!</p>


The copy is considered equal to the original, since it represents the
same markup as the original, but itâs not the same object:
print soup.p == p_copy
# True

print soup.p is p_copy
# False


The only real difference is that the copy is completely detached from
the original Beautiful Soup object tree, just as if extract() had
been called on it:
print p_copy.parent
# None


This is because two different Tag objects canât occupy the same
space at the same time.


Parsing only part of a documentÂ¶
Letâs say you want to use Beautiful Soup look at a documentâs <a>
tags. Itâs a waste of time and memory to parse the entire document and
then go over it again looking for <a> tags. It would be much faster to
ignore everything that wasnât an <a> tag in the first place. The
SoupStrainer class allows you to choose which parts of an incoming
document are parsed. You just create a SoupStrainer and pass it in
to the BeautifulSoup constructor as the parse_only argument.
(Note that this feature wonât work if youâre using the html5lib parser.
If you use html5lib, the whole document will be parsed, no
matter what. This is because html5lib constantly rearranges the parse
tree as it works, and if some part of the document didnât actually
make it into the parse tree, itâll crash. To avoid confusion, in the
examples below Iâll be forcing Beautiful Soup to use Pythonâs
built-in parser.)

SoupStrainerÂ¶
The SoupStrainer class takes the same arguments as a typical
method from Searching the tree: name, attrs, string, and **kwargs. Here are
three SoupStrainer objects:
from bs4 import SoupStrainer

only_a_tags = SoupStrainer("a")

only_tags_with_id_link2 = SoupStrainer(id="link2")

def is_short_string(string):
    return len(string) < 10

only_short_strings = SoupStrainer(string=is_short_string)


Iâm going to bring back the âthree sistersâ document one more time,
and weâll see what the document looks like when itâs parsed with these
three SoupStrainer objects:
html_doc = """
<html><head><title>The Dormouse's story</title></head>
<body>
<p class="title"><b>The Dormouse's story</b></p>

<p class="story">Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were
<a href="http://example.com/elsie" class="sister" id="link1">Elsie</a>,
<a href="http://example.com/lacie" class="sister" id="link2">Lacie</a> and
<a href="http://example.com/tillie" class="sister" id="link3">Tillie</a>;
and they lived at the bottom of a well.</p>

<p class="story">...</p>
"""

print(BeautifulSoup(html_doc, "html.parser", parse_only=only_a_tags).prettify())
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/elsie" id="link1">
#  Elsie
# </a>
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">
#  Lacie
# </a>
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/tillie" id="link3">
#  Tillie
# </a>

print(BeautifulSoup(html_doc, "html.parser", parse_only=only_tags_with_id_link2).prettify())
# <a class="sister" href="http://example.com/lacie" id="link2">
#  Lacie
# </a>

print(BeautifulSoup(html_doc, "html.parser", parse_only=only_short_strings).prettify())
# Elsie
# ,
# Lacie
# and
# Tillie
# ...
#


You can also pass a SoupStrainer into any of the methods covered
in Searching the tree. This probably isnât terribly useful, but I
thought Iâd mention it:
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc)
soup.find_all(only_short_strings)
# [u'\n\n', u'\n\n', u'Elsie', u',\n', u'Lacie', u' and\n', u'Tillie',
#  u'\n\n', u'...', u'\n']





TroubleshootingÂ¶

diagnose()Â¶
If youâre having trouble understanding what Beautiful Soup does to a
document, pass the document into the diagnose() function. (New in
Beautiful Soup 4.2.0.)  Beautiful Soup will print out a report showing
you how different parsers handle the document, and tell you if youâre
missing a parser that Beautiful Soup could be using:
from bs4.diagnose import diagnose
with open("bad.html") as fp:
    data = fp.read()
diagnose(data)

# Diagnostic running on Beautiful Soup 4.2.0
# Python version 2.7.3 (default, Aug  1 2012, 05:16:07)
# I noticed that html5lib is not installed. Installing it may help.
# Found lxml version 2.3.2.0
#
# Trying to parse your data with html.parser
# Here's what html.parser did with the document:
# ...


Just looking at the output of diagnose() may show you how to solve the
problem. Even if not, you can paste the output of diagnose() when
asking for help.


Errors when parsing a documentÂ¶
There are two different kinds of parse errors. There are crashes,
where you feed a document to Beautiful Soup and it raises an
exception, usually an HTMLParser.HTMLParseError. And there is
unexpected behavior, where a Beautiful Soup parse tree looks a lot
different than the document used to create it.
Almost none of these problems turn out to be problems with Beautiful
Soup. This is not because Beautiful Soup is an amazingly well-written
piece of software. Itâs because Beautiful Soup doesnât include any
parsing code. Instead, it relies on external parsers. If one parser
isnât working on a certain document, the best solution is to try a
different parser. See Installing a parser for details and a parser
comparison.
The most common parse errors are HTMLParser.HTMLParseError:
malformed start tag and HTMLParser.HTMLParseError: bad end
tag. These are both generated by Pythonâs built-in HTML parser
library, and the solution is to install lxml or
html5lib.
The most common type of unexpected behavior is that you canât find a
tag that you know is in the document. You saw it going in, but
find_all() returns [] or find() returns None. This is
another common problem with Pythonâs built-in HTML parser, which
sometimes skips tags it doesnât understand.  Again, the solution is to
install lxml or html5lib.


Version mismatch problemsÂ¶

SyntaxError: Invalid syntax (on the line ROOT_TAG_NAME =
u'[document]'): Caused by running the Python 2 version of
Beautiful Soup under Python 3, without converting the code.
ImportError: No module named HTMLParser - Caused by running the
Python 2 version of Beautiful Soup under Python 3.
ImportError: No module named html.parser - Caused by running the
Python 3 version of Beautiful Soup under Python 2.
ImportError: No module named BeautifulSoup - Caused by running
Beautiful Soup 3 code on a system that doesnât have BS3
installed. Or, by writing Beautiful Soup 4 code without knowing that
the package name has changed to bs4.
ImportError: No module named bs4 - Caused by running Beautiful
Soup 4 code on a system that doesnât have BS4 installed.



Parsing XMLÂ¶
By default, Beautiful Soup parses documents as HTML. To parse a
document as XML, pass in âxmlâ as the second argument to the
BeautifulSoup constructor:
soup = BeautifulSoup(markup, "xml")


Youâll need to have lxml installed.


Other parser problemsÂ¶

If your script works on one computer but not another, or in one
virtual environment but not another, or outside the virtual
environment but not inside, itâs probably because the two
environments have different parser libraries available. For example,
you may have developed the script on a computer that has lxml
installed, and then tried to run it on a computer that only has
html5lib installed. See Differences between parsers for why this
matters, and fix the problem by mentioning a specific parser library
in the BeautifulSoup constructor.
Because HTML tags and attributes are case-insensitive, all three HTML
parsers convert tag and attribute names to lowercase. That is, the
markup <TAG></TAG> is converted to <tag></tag>. If you want to
preserve mixed-case or uppercase tags and attributes, youâll need to
parse the document as XML.



MiscellaneousÂ¶

UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character
u'\xfoo' in position bar (or just about any other
UnicodeEncodeError) - This is not a problem with Beautiful Soup.
This problem shows up in two main situations. First, when you try to
print a Unicode character that your console doesnât know how to
display. (See this page on the Python wiki for help.) Second, when
youâre writing to a file and you pass in a Unicode character thatâs
not supported by your default encoding.  In this case, the simplest
solution is to explicitly encode the Unicode string into UTF-8 with
u.encode("utf8").
KeyError: [attr] - Caused by accessing tag['attr'] when the
tag in question doesnât define the attr attribute. The most
common errors are KeyError: 'href' and KeyError:
'class'. Use tag.get('attr') if youâre not sure attr is
defined, just as you would with a Python dictionary.
AttributeError: 'ResultSet' object has no attribute 'foo' - This
usually happens because you expected find_all() to return a
single tag or string. But find_all() returns a _list_ of tags
and stringsâa ResultSet object. You need to iterate over the
list and look at the .foo of each one. Or, if you really only
want one result, you need to use find() instead of
find_all().
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'foo' - This
usually happens because you called find() and then tried to
access the .foo` attribute of the result. But in your case,
find() didnât find anything, so it returned None, instead of
returning a tag or a string. You need to figure out why your
find() call isnât returning anything.



Improving PerformanceÂ¶
Beautiful Soup will never be as fast as the parsers it sits on top
of. If response time is critical, if youâre paying for computer time
by the hour, or if thereâs any other reason why computer time is more
valuable than programmer time, you should forget about Beautiful Soup
and work directly atop lxml.
That said, there are things you can do to speed up Beautiful Soup. If
youâre not using lxml as the underlying parser, my advice is to
start. Beautiful Soup parses documents
significantly faster using lxml than using html.parser or html5lib.
You can speed up encoding detection significantly by installing the
cchardet library.
Parsing only part of a document wonât save you much time parsing
the document, but it can save a lot of memory, and itâll make
searching the document much faster.



Translating this documentationÂ¶
New translations of the Beautiful Soup documentation are greatly
appreciated. Translations should be licensed under the MIT license,
just like Beautiful Soup and its English documentation are.
There are two ways of getting your translation into the main code base
and onto the Beautiful Soup website:

Create a branch of the Beautiful Soup repository, add your
translation, and propose a merge with the main branch, the same
as you would do with a proposed change to the source code.
Send a message to the Beautiful Soup discussion group with a link to
your translation, or attach your translation to the message.

Use the Chinese or Brazilian Portuguese translations as your model. In
particular, please translate the source file doc/source/index.rst,
rather than the HTML version of the documentation. This makes it
possible to publish the documentation in a variety of formats, not
just HTML.


Beautiful Soup 3Â¶
Beautiful Soup 3 is the previous release series, and is no longer
being actively developed. Itâs currently packaged with all major Linux
distributions:
$ apt-get install python-beautifulsoup
Itâs also published through PyPi as BeautifulSoup.:
$ easy_install BeautifulSoup
$ pip install BeautifulSoup
You can also download a tarball of Beautiful Soup 3.2.0.
If you ran easy_install beautifulsoup or easy_install
BeautifulSoup, but your code doesnât work, you installed Beautiful
Soup 3 by mistake. You need to run easy_install beautifulsoup4.
The documentation for Beautiful Soup 3 is archived online.

Porting code to BS4Â¶
Most code written against Beautiful Soup 3 will work against Beautiful
Soup 4 with one simple change. All you should have to do is change the
package name from BeautifulSoup to bs4. So this:
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup


becomes this:
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup



If you get the ImportError âNo module named BeautifulSoupâ, your
problem is that youâre trying to run Beautiful Soup 3 code, but you
only have Beautiful Soup 4 installed.
If you get the ImportError âNo module named bs4â, your problem
is that youâre trying to run Beautiful Soup 4 code, but you only
have Beautiful Soup 3 installed.

Although BS4 is mostly backwards-compatible with BS3, most of its
methods have been deprecated and given new names for PEP 8 compliance. There are numerous other
renames and changes, and a few of them break backwards compatibility.
Hereâs what youâll need to know to convert your BS3 code and habits to BS4:

You need a parserÂ¶
Beautiful Soup 3 used Pythonâs SGMLParser, a module that was
deprecated and removed in Python 3.0. Beautiful Soup 4 uses
html.parser by default, but you can plug in lxml or html5lib and
use that instead. See Installing a parser for a comparison.
Since html.parser is not the same parser as SGMLParser, you
may find that Beautiful Soup 4 gives you a different parse tree than
Beautiful Soup 3 for the same markup. If you swap out html.parser
for lxml or html5lib, you may find that the parse tree changes yet
again. If this happens, youâll need to update your scraping code to
deal with the new tree.


Method namesÂ¶

renderContents -> encode_contents
replaceWith -> replace_with
replaceWithChildren -> unwrap
findAll -> find_all
findAllNext -> find_all_next
findAllPrevious -> find_all_previous
findNext -> find_next
findNextSibling -> find_next_sibling
findNextSiblings -> find_next_siblings
findParent -> find_parent
findParents -> find_parents
findPrevious -> find_previous
findPreviousSibling -> find_previous_sibling
findPreviousSiblings -> find_previous_siblings
getText -> get_text
nextSibling -> next_sibling
previousSibling -> previous_sibling

Some arguments to the Beautiful Soup constructor were renamed for the
same reasons:

BeautifulSoup(parseOnlyThese=...) -> BeautifulSoup(parse_only=...)
BeautifulSoup(fromEncoding=...) -> BeautifulSoup(from_encoding=...)

I renamed one method for compatibility with Python 3:

Tag.has_key() -> Tag.has_attr()

I renamed one attribute to use more accurate terminology:

Tag.isSelfClosing -> Tag.is_empty_element

I renamed three attributes to avoid using words that have special
meaning to Python. Unlike the others, these changes are not backwards
compatible. If you used these attributes in BS3, your code will break
on BS4 until you change them.

UnicodeDammit.unicode -> UnicodeDammit.unicode_markup
Tag.next -> Tag.next_element
Tag.previous -> Tag.previous_element



GeneratorsÂ¶
I gave the generators PEP 8-compliant names, and transformed them into
properties:

childGenerator() -> children
nextGenerator() -> next_elements
nextSiblingGenerator() -> next_siblings
previousGenerator() -> previous_elements
previousSiblingGenerator() -> previous_siblings
recursiveChildGenerator() -> descendants
parentGenerator() -> parents

So instead of this:
for parent in tag.parentGenerator():
    ...


You can write this:
for parent in tag.parents:
    ...


(But the old code will still work.)
Some of the generators used to yield None after they were done, and
then stop. That was a bug. Now the generators just stop.
There are two new generators, .strings and
.stripped_strings. .strings yields
NavigableString objects, and .stripped_strings yields Python
strings that have had whitespace stripped.


XMLÂ¶
There is no longer a BeautifulStoneSoup class for parsing XML. To
parse XML you pass in âxmlâ as the second argument to the
BeautifulSoup constructor. For the same reason, the
BeautifulSoup constructor no longer recognizes the isHTML
argument.
Beautiful Soupâs handling of empty-element XML tags has been
improved. Previously when you parsed XML you had to explicitly say
which tags were considered empty-element tags. The selfClosingTags
argument to the constructor is no longer recognized. Instead,
Beautiful Soup considers any empty tag to be an empty-element tag. If
you add a child to an empty-element tag, it stops being an
empty-element tag.


EntitiesÂ¶
An incoming HTML or XML entity is always converted into the
corresponding Unicode character. Beautiful Soup 3 had a number of
overlapping ways of dealing with entities, which have been
removed. The BeautifulSoup constructor no longer recognizes the
smartQuotesTo or convertEntities arguments. (Unicode,
Dammit still has smart_quotes_to, but its default is now to turn
smart quotes into Unicode.) The constants HTML_ENTITIES,
XML_ENTITIES, and XHTML_ENTITIES have been removed, since they
configure a feature (transforming some but not all entities into
Unicode characters) that no longer exists.
If you want to turn Unicode characters back into HTML entities on
output, rather than turning them into UTF-8 characters, you need to
use an output formatter.


MiscellaneousÂ¶
Tag.string now operates recursively. If tag A
contains a single tag B and nothing else, then A.string is the same as
B.string. (Previously, it was None.)
Multi-valued attributes like class have lists of strings as
their values, not strings. This may affect the way you search by CSS
class.
If you pass one of the find* methods both string and
a tag-specific argument like name, Beautiful Soup will
search for tags that match your tag-specific criteria and whose
Tag.string matches your value for string. It will not find the strings themselves. Previously,
Beautiful Soup ignored the tag-specific arguments and looked for
strings.
The BeautifulSoup constructor no longer recognizes the
markupMassage argument. Itâs now the parserâs responsibility to
handle markup correctly.
The rarely-used alternate parser classes like
ICantBelieveItsBeautifulSoup and BeautifulSOAP have been
removed. Itâs now the parserâs decision how to handle ambiguous
markup.
The prettify() method now returns a Unicode string, not a bytestring.
