XML Schema
The XML Schema Working Group is closed, having completed its work successfully.
    The specifications are now maintained by the
    W3C XML Core Working Group.

Development

XML Schemas express shared vocabularies and allow machines to carry out
rules made by people. They provide a means for defining the structure,
content and semantics of XML documents.  in more
detail.
XML Schema 1.0 was approved as a W3C Recommendation on 2 May 2001 and a second
edition incorporating many errata was published on 28 October 2004; see
reference list for pointers.
The XML Schema Working Group, part of the XML Activity, is responsible for the W3C's
work on this topic -- for details see the Working Group's 
charter.
W3C Members can also participate in the W3C XML Schema Interest Group,
a forum for the discussion of technical issues relating to the
development of XML Schema.
See also: Robin Cover's index of XML Schema
materials.




XML Schema 1.1Status
XML Schema 1.1 (in two parts) is a W3C Recommendation.
    It is intended to be mostly
compatible with XML Schema 1.0 and to have approximately the same
scope, but also to fix bugs and make whatever improvements we can,
consistent with the constraints on scope and compatibility.
XML Schema 1.1 Part 2: Datatypes and XML Schema 1.1
	Part 1: Structures are available.
There is also a
    Test Collection aimed at determining which parts of XSD 1.1 have been implemented;
    several implementations are under development.
If you find errors in Schema 1.1, please let us know.  The best way to do
that is to add an entry to the W3C's public 
installation of Bugzilla,
which the WG uses to track issues and enhancement requests,
specifying "XML Schema" as the 'product' name.  Full instructions
can be found at http://www.w3.org/XML/2006/01/public-bugzilla. If access to
Bugzilla is not feasible, please send your comments to the W3C XML
Schema Working Group's public comments mailing list, 
www-xml-schema-commentsAw3.org 
(archive).
Please note that both the Bugzilla installation and the comments list are 
not only public-write but also
public-read; don't say things you don't want seen in public.
Each Bugzilla entry and email message should contain only one
comment.

The Bugzilla system should also be used to report errors with XML Schema 1.0.
Thanks!

CodeSynthesis XSD - XML Schema to C++ compiler

CodeSynthesis XSD 3.0.0 - Open-source XML Schema to C++ compiler Boris Kolpackov 2007-08-01
CodeSynthesis XSD is an open-source, cross-platform W3C XML Schema to C++
    data binding compiler. Provided with a schema, it generates C++ classes
    that represent the given vocabulary as well as parsing and serialization
    code. You can then access the data stored in XML using types and functions
    that semantically correspond to your application domain rather than
    dealing with elements, attributes, and text in a direct representation
    of XML such as DOM or SAX.
XSD supports both in-memory and stream-oriented processing models by
    implementing two C++ mappings: C++/Tree and C++/Parser. The C++/Tree
    mapping represents the information stored in XML instance documents
    as a tree-like, in-memory object model. The C++/Parser mapping
    generates parser skeletons for data types defined in XML Schema. Using
    these parser skeletons you can build your own in-memory representations
    or perform immediate processing of XML documents.
XSD is available on AIX, GNU/Linux, HP-UX, Mac OS X, Solaris, and Windows.
    Supported C++ compilers include: GNU g++, HP aCC, Intel C++, Sun C++,
    IBM XL C++, and MS Visual C++. More information as well as precompiled
    binaries for all supported platforms are available from
    http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/

CodeSynthesis XSD/e - validating XML processing for embedded systems

CodeSynthesis XSD/e 2.0.0 released Boris Kolpackov 2007-11-13
CodeSynthesis XSD/e is an open-source XML parser/serializer generator
    for mobile and embedded systems. It provides event-driven,
    stream-oriented XML parsing, XML serialization, XML Schema validation,
    and C++ data binding while maintaining a small footprint and
    portability.
Compared to general-purpose validating XML processors, the XSD/e-generated
    code is 2-10 times faster while maintaining the lowest static and
    dynamic memory footprints. For example, a validating parser executable
    can be as small as 120KB in size. XSD/e is also highly-portable and can
    be used without STL, RTTI, iostream, C++ exceptions, and C++ templates.
Supported embedded toolchains include GNU g++ 2.95.x-4.x.x, eMbedded
    Visual C++ 4.0, and Visual Studio 2005 with Smart Devices support.
    Precompiled binary distributions are available for GNU/Linux, Solaris,
    and Windows host development platforms.
More information, documentation, source code, and precompiled binaries
    are available from
    http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsde/

LINQ to XSD

LINQ to XSD Preview
Alpha 0.1 released to the web Ralf Lämmel 2006-11-27
LINQ to XSD is the code name of an incubation project that aims to provide .NET developers with support for typed XML programming on top of LINQ to XML. While the LINQ to XML programmer operates on generic XML trees, the LINQ to XSD programmer operates on typed XML trees -- instances of .NET types that model the XML types of a specific XML schema (XSD). LINQ to XSD can be used whenever you have an XML schema available, or you are willing to infer a schema from the XML data at hand. LINQ to XSD is integrated into Visual Studio; so you just tag an XML schema as an 'LINQ to XSD schema', build your project, and the automatically derived object model is then part of your solution -- just as if XML schemas were .NET types. The derived object model enforces various validation constraints imposed by the underlying XML schema.

NetBeans Schema support


Chris Webster  2006-06-25
The XML schema tools available in the NetBeans Enterprise Pack 5.5  
Early Access release allow you to visualize and edit XML schemas. The  
XML schema tools focus on complex information display and real-world  
use issues (for example, scalable visualization and editing of  
massive XML schemas). In addition, the XML schema tools reduce the  
complexity of creating and editing XML schemas, thus allowing someone  
who is not a schema expert to create and modify XML schema and other  
XML documents. Using the XML schema tools, you can reference external  
schemas and run advanced queries in the Analysis view.

Using XML schema functionality, you can:


Visualize and edit an XML schema in a scalable fashion using
the Schema view
Edit a schema via an abstract instance view which provides an
editable visualization of the instance document structure
Query and Visualize the Schema
Perform refactoring across XML Schema, WSDL, and BPEL

The new version adds an XSLT 2.0 implementation of NVDL dispatching and 
fixes a couple of issues.


oXygen

oXygen XML Editor 8.2 George Cristian Bina 2007-05-08
A new version of oXygen XML editor is available from our website
http://www.oxygenxml.com.
Version 8.2 introduces a concept of validation scenarios. These 
decouples the current file from the validation and allows you to specify 
a list of files to be validated instead, as well as the processors to be 
used. Thus it enables multiple validations in a single action and 
validating modules in the context they are used from.
The new version adds support for ISO Schematron and that mans also 
support for XML Schema with ISO Schematron embedded rules including 
content completion inside annotation/appinfo for ISO Schematron and 
validation of XML files against XML Schema with embedded ISO Schematron 
rules.

Other important additions in version 8.2 are an XQuery debugger against 
MarkLogic 3.2 native XML database, a large file viewer capable of 
opening files larger than a Gigabyte, multi-line search/replace support, 
a number of component updates and a lot of other additions.

Visual Schema

Visual XML Schemas Siva Dirisala 2008-01-06
Even though many of the XML Schemas are meant for functional users so
that
they can design new systems or map existing systems to be standards
compliant,
their complexity makes it difficult for these users to study them. Even many

software developers have difficulty understanding the XML Schemas due to
their
complexity. Visual Schema addresses this problem by presenting the XML
Schemas
as familiar and easily navigable html forms, typically found in enterprise
business applications, that help the users easily understand the structure
of
an XML document.
Serveral open standards such as OAGIS and publicly available web
services
such as Amazon Web Services are available as Visual XML Schemas
at http://www.visualschema.com/


XBinder XSD to C/C++ schema compiler

XBinder XSD to C/C++ schema compiler Ed Day 13-Dec-2005
XBinder is an XML Schema to C/C++ Data Binding Tool. Given an XML schema or WSDL definition, it will produce 
 C or C++ code that consists of type definitions and encode/decode functions. This provides a complete Application 
 Programming Interface (API) for working with all of the message definitions contained within an XML schema 
 specification.
 
XBinder supports all types included within XML schema including complex and simple content and substitution 
 groups.  Also supported is include and import to allow schemas to be modularized.  Some large schemas that have 
 been compiled cleanly include UBL, FIXML, FpML, and CSTA.

XML Infoset Browser

XML Infoset Browser for Java, Ed Merks, 2002-09-18
We are very pleased to announce the availability of
org.eclipse.xsd, the XML Schema Infoset Model for Java, at Eclipse:http://www.eclipse.org/xsd/.
org.eclipse.xsd is a Java reference library that
implements the XML Schema Infoset Model as described in the W3C XML
Schema specifications.  We believe that it will be useful for any code
that examines, creates, or modifies XML Schemas (standalone or as part
of other artifacts, such as XForms or WSDL documents). The library
provides an API for manipulating the components of an XML Schema, as
well as an API for manipulating the DOM-accessible representation of
XML Schema as a series of XML documents, and for keeping these
representations in agreement as schemas are modified.

XML Nanny

XML Nanny, Todd Ditchendorf, 2005-12-16
I've developed a free (as in beer) Cocoa XML Schema-related developer  
tool for Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger called XML Nanny: http://xmlnanny.com.
XML Nanny is a graphical tool for checking XML documents for well- 
formedness or validity against a DTD or W3C XML Schema. XML Nanny can  
validate documents either locally or over the network.

XS3P

XS3p is a
schema documentation generator developed by Zar Zar Tun at
DSTC. Basically, it is an XSLT stylesheet that will generate an XHTML
document from an XSD schema. Some of its cool features are:


It provides links that allow the user to jump to the documentation of schema components that are referenced. 
It provides a view of schema components' constraints as a sample XML instance. 
For global type definitions, it shows the super- and sub- types of the type definition. 
For global element declarations, it shows the substitution groups that the element declaration heads or belongs to. 
It can sort schema components by type and name. 
It has a glossary section which explains some XML Schema terminology. 

DSTC no longer exists, and the original homepage for this tool is gone.  Both
oXygen and Stylus Studio appear to use it, and search engines can
locate copies of the stylesheet and, in some cases, the license without which it
cannot legally be used.

xsd2cpp
XmlPlus xsd2cpp
	is an open-source tool which provides XML data
	binding for C++ through XML Schema.
	The xsd2cpp tool is a C++ code generator. The xsd2cpp tool when invoked on
	an input XML Schema, generates C++ classes(headers) mapped to the input XML
	Schema components. Alongside, wherever needed, it generates implementation
	files(.cpp) for the generated C++ classes. Also, a sample
	application(main.cpp) is generated to demonstrate how an application could
	consume the generated C++ source files.

XSDBench XML Schema Benchmark

XSDBench XML Schema Benchmark 1.0.0 released Boris Kolpackov 2006-10-18
XSDBench is an open-source W3C XML Schema benchmark that compares the
    performance of validating XML parsers. It measures validation throughput,
    statically-linked test executable size, and, where possible, peak heap
    and stack memory usage during parsing. The following parsers are
    supported in the latest release:

Apache Xerces-C++
CodeSynthesis XSD
Gnome Libxml2
Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML)
Oracle XDK

More information on the benchmark architecture, results, as well as
    the benchmark source code are available from
    http://www.codesynthesis.com/projects/xsdbench

XSD Inference Tool

XSD from examples, Microsoft, 2002-12-14
We would like to announce the availabitlity of Microsoft XSD Inference
Beta 1 tool.  The Microsoft XSD Inference utility is used to create an XML Schema definition language (XSD) schema from an XML instance document. When provided with wellformed XML file, the utility generates an XSD that can be used to validate that XML file. You can also refine the XSD generated by providing the tool more well-formed XML files.
You can get the binaries and documentation from http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/xmltools/


XSD/e

XSD/e 1.1.0 - validating XML parser generator for embedded systems Boris
Kolpackov 2007-09-20
CodeSynthesis XSD/e is an open-source XML parser generator for mobile and
embedded systems. It provides event-driven, stream-oriented XML parsing, XML
Schema validation, and C++ data binding while maintaining small footprint and
portability.
Compared to general-purpose validating XML parsers, the XSD/e-generated
parsers are 2-10 times faster while maintaining the lowest static and dynamic
memory footprints. For example, a validating parser executable can be as small
as 120KB in size. XSD/e is also highly-portable and can be used without STL,
RTTI, iostream, C++ exceptions, and C++ templates.
Supported embedded toolchains include GNU g++ 2.95.x-4.x.x, eMbedded Visual
C++ 4.0, and Visual Studio 2005 with Smart Devices support. Precompiled binary
distributions are available for GNU/Linux, Solaris, and Windows host
development platforms.
More information, documentation, source code, and precompiled binaries are
available from http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsde/

xsdregex

XSD
regex-> Java 1.4 regex, James Clark 2002-04-30
I've written some Java code that translates from the syntax of XSD
regexes to the syntax of JDK 1.4 java.util.regex regexes.  The source,
binaries and documentation can be downloaded from: [http://www.thaiopensource.com/download/xsdregex-20020430.zip]

I am releasing it under a very liberal license (the BSD license),
which makes it free even for commercial use.

XSD-to-C++

xsd - a W3C XML Schema to C++ translator Boris Kolpackov 2005-10-08
xsd is a cross-platform, open source W3C XML Schema to C++ 
   translator. It supports two C++ mappings: in-memory C++/Tree and 
   event-driven C++/Parser.
The C++/Tree mapping consists of data types that represent the given 
   vocabulary, a set of parsing functions that convert XML instance 
   documents to a tree-like in-memory data structure, and a set of 
   serialization functions that convert the in-memory representation 
   back to XML.
The C++/Parser mapping provides parser templates for data types 
   defined in XML Schema. Using these parser templates you can build 
   your own in-memory representations or perform immediate processing 
   of XML instance documents.

LOGML
(Log Markup Language) Draft Specification and Schema John Punin Jun

OpenGIS Consortium, Schema for Geography Markup Language (GML) 2.0.
Three schema documents are normative:

feature.xsd defines an XML encoding for the OGC/ISO TC211 "Feature"
model for geospatial data,
geometry.xsd defines geometry elements <include>d into
feature.xsd
xlinks.xsd is a schema for XLinks (actually a placeholder until a
definitive version is provided by W3C) and is also used by
feature.xsd

Guidelines for developing usable application-specific schemas are
included as a normative chapter of the specification. A recent vote by
the Technical Committee of OGC has elevated GML 2.0 to the status of
"adopted technology". (update
