Sponsors of Read the DocsÂ¶
Running Read the Docs isnât free, and the site wouldnât be where it is today
without generous support of our sponsors. Below is a list of all the folks who
have helped the site financially, in order of the date they first started
supporting us.

Current sponsorsÂ¶

AWS - They cover all of our hosting expenses every month.  This is a pretty large sum of money, averaging around $5,000/mo.
Cloudflare - Cloudflare is providing us with an enterprise plan of their SSL for SaaS Providers product that enables us to provide SSL certificates for custom domains.
Chan Zuckerberg Initiative - Through their âEssential Open Source Software for Scienceâ programme, they fund our ongoing efforts to improve scientific documentation
and make Read the Docs a better service for scientific projects.
