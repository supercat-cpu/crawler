“If you don’t make it beautiful, it’s for sure doomed”: putting the Vault in GitHub’s Arctic Code VaultGitHub this month installed a massive steel vault, etched with striking AI-generated art, deep within an Arctic mountain, finalizing its Arctic Code Vault. This vault contains the 188 reels of hardened archival film which will preserve the 02/02/2020 snapshot of every active public GitHub repository for 1,000 years. It also now includes a Tech Tree, a human-readable selection of works describing software, computers, and their foundational technologies, along with full-text copies of Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, and other data sources.

Corrupting memory without memory corruptionIn this post I’ll exploit CVE-2022-20186, a vulnerability in the Arm Mali GPU kernel driver and use it to gain arbitrary kernel memory access from an untrusted app on a Pixel 6. This then allows me to gain root and disable SELinux. This vulnerability highlights the strong primitives that an attacker may gain by exploiting errors in the memory management code of GPU drivers.
