lxml is the most feature-rich and easy-to-use library for processing XML and HTML in the Python language.
lxml is a Pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries. It is unique in that it combines the speed and feature completeness of these libraries with the simplicity of a native Python API, mostly compatible to the well-known ElementTree API, but with a heavily extended feature set.
The project is mainly driven by interest through the mailing list. Join us there!
