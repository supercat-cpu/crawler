Read the Docs TeamÂ¶
readthedocs.org is the largest open source documentation hosting service.
Today we:

Serve over 55 million pages of documentation a month
Serve over 40 TB of documentation a month
Host over 80,000 open source projects and support over 100,000 users

Read the Docs is provided as a free service to the open source community,
and we hope to maintain a reliable and stable hosting platform for years to come.

StaffÂ¶
The members of the Staff work full time on the service,
and we are also honored to have several external contributors.
We mainly fund our operations through advertising
and corporate-hosted documentation with Read the Docs for Business,
and we are supported by a number of generous sponsors.

TeamsÂ¶

The Backend Team folks develop the Django code that powers the backend of the project.
The members of the Frontend Team care about UX, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript,
and they maintain the project UI as well as the Sphinx theme.
As part of operating the site, members of the Operations Team maintain a 24/7 on-call rotation.
This means that folks have to be available and have their phone in service.
The members of the Advocacy Team spread the word about all the work we do,
and seek to understand the users priorities and feedback.
The Support Team helps our thousands of users using the service,
addressing tasks like resetting passwords, enable experimental features, or troubleshooting build errors.


Note
Please donât email us personally for support on Read the Docs.
You can use our support form
for any issues you may have.




Major ContributorsÂ¶
The code that powers the Read the Docs platform,
as well as many other related projects in our GitHub organization,
are open source, and therefore
anybody can contribute.
Our platform code has over a hundred
contributors,
which makes us extremely proud and thankful.
In addition, several contributors have performed ongoing maintenance on several subprojects
over the years:

Aaron Carlisle for our Sphinx theme.
Ashley Whetter for our autoapi Sphinx extension.

We know that weâre missing a large number of people who have contributed in major ways to our various projects.
Please let us know if you feel that you should be on this list, and arenât!
