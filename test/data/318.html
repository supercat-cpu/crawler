Engineering Managers and Developers now have a single tool to optimize the performance of their code and deliver fast customer experiences.See a Sample TransactionPython Error Monitoring with Complete Stack TracesSee local variables in the stack for prod errors, just like in your dev environment. Introspect more deeply into the runtime and jump into the frame to get additional data for any local variable. Filter and group Python exceptions intuitively to eliminate noise.See a Sample Stack TraceFill In the Blanks About Python ErrorsExpose the important events that led to each Python exception: SQL queries, debug logs, network requests, past errors. Improve debugging workflow with a full view of releases so you can mark errors as resolved and prioritize live issues.Check out Breadcrumbs”The time to resolve errors went from days to minutes.”Vaidik KapoorVP of Engineering at GrofersDebugging Any Python ExceptionAggregate errors by details like HTTP request, hostname, and app version to see what’s new, a priority, or a trend.Assign custom tags to reproduce the error environment specific to your application, business, and users.Answer the most important questions: In which app release did thePython bug occur? Was it the kraken?FAQsWhat is the difference between Sentry and traditional logging?Traditional logging provides you with a trail of events. Some of those events are errors, but many times they’re simply informational. Sentry is fundamentally different because we focus on exceptions, or in other words, we capture application crashes. We discuss in more detail here and on our blog.What  languages does Sentry support?Sentry supports every major  language, framework, and library. You can browse each of them here.How much does Sentry cost?You can get started for free. Pricing depends on the number of monthly events, transactions, and attachments that you send Sentry. For more details, visit our pricing page.How does Sentry impact the performance of my app?Sentry doesn’t impact a web site’s performance.If you look at the configuration options for when you initialize Sentry in your code, you’ll see there’s nothing regarding minimizing its impact on your app’s performance. This is because our team of SDK engineers already developed Sentry with this in mind.Sentry is a listener/handler for errors that asynchronously sends out the error/event to Sentry.io. This is non-blocking. The error/event only goes out if this is an error.Global handlers have almost no impact as well, as they are native APIs provided by the browsers.Supporting ResourcesDebugging Python ErrorsReadHow Sentry Helps Grofers Meet Unprecedented Delivery DemandReadResolve Python errors with max efficiency, not max effortTry Sentry For FreeRequest a DemoProductFeaturesPricingDocumentationIntegrationsStatusCompanyBlogAbout UsCareersCustomersCommunityOpen SourceIn The NewsMedia ResourcesInformationTrust CenterSecurity & CompliancePrivacyTermsTransparency ReportSupportResourcesAnswersPlatformsJavaScript.NETPythonAndroidPHPDjangoJavaFlaskRubyLaraveliOSRailsNodeReactGoSee allTwitterGitHubDribbbleLinkedin© 2022 • Sentry is a registered Trademark of Functional Software, Inc.
