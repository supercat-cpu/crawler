Python Community Server



myelin: Python Community Server
provided free hosting for Radio, bzero and PyDS weblogs, 2002-2005


The Python Community Server was one of the early blog hosts, running from March 2002 until sometime in 2005 or 2006.
This site is now a read-only archive of the community that existed during that time.  Enjoy!
If you had a blog here, it still gets incoming traffic, and you would like it to be redirected to your new blog, please drop Phil a line and he will set it up for you.
You are welcome to host a weblog here (it's free).  If you already have a copy of Radio UserLand, you can move your existing blog over here.  Otherwise, try one of the following:

Windows: Download and install Radio/PyCS for Windows or PyDS for Windows.
Mac: Download and install Radio/PyCS for Mac OS X or install PyDS from source.
Linux: Download and install bzero or PyDS (from source | Debian).


More information
Python Community Server is an open source server for hosting weblogs, written completely in Python.
It implements the xmlStorageSystem protocol, so you can host weblogs produced with Radio UserLand, Python Desktop Server, and bzero.
* Discuss Python Community Server on the CommunityServerWiki.
Or: Run your own Python Community Server.
