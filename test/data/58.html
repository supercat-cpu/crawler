How Pingdom Can Work for You

See how the SolarWinds Pingdom complete website monitoring platform can help you reach your website goals.



For Digital Marketers


For Digital Marketers
Your site is your digital storefront. Your marketing collateral and campaigns have brought them to your site, but if it’s unavailable, slow, or broken, it could hurt your brand and your business objectives. Help ensure your customers have the best experience on your site with synthetic monitoring. You’ll be the first to know if your site is unavailable or slow, or if a site interaction is broken. Comprehensive monitoring includes real user monitoring. How your visitors experience your site can differ depending on the browser, device, and platform they use. Identify improvements, compare year-over-year data, and inform marketing decisions with usage metrics like top visited pages, top platforms, top browsers, active sessions, and bounce rates.




 



For Web Hosting Providers


For Web Hosting Providers
Pingdom helps you provide excellent service and third-party proof of meeting key service objectives and SLAs with sharable and customizable reporting. As a web hosting provider, you may have agreements about site performance with your clients. For example, websites will be up 99.9% of the time, or webpages will have less than 3 seconds of load time. Because of these agreements, you should always be the first to know if an incident has occurred. If a website hosted by your service is unavailable, slow, or not functioning as expected, you can make sure the right people are alerted immediately. With Pingdom real user monitoring, you can set performance levels for what’s considered satisfactory, so you can help ensure a seamless site experience for your customers. Public status pages allow you to provide third-party proof of achieving SLAs and keeping your customers happy.
 




 



For Web Developers


For Web Developers
Before you push a change into production, make sure it isn’t going to have a negative impact on the availability or performance of your web application. Test performance while in development and troubleshoot issues in production—identify bottlenecks, get actionable insights, and speed up your website. With uptime monitoring, you can avoid unnecessary downtime and be alerted as soon as your site isn’t available. Page speed monitoring will help you make optimization decisions armed with the size and load time of every element. Real user monitoring helps you filter by geography, device, or browser when real users are experiencing a problem. You can also leverage performance insights generated by Pingdom within your existing systems or portals with the Pingdom API. Create new API queries typically in minutes with our simplified implementation.

                                "No human could ever keep track of whether 280 sites, services, tools, APIs, and apps are running, running well or running fast. Pingdom does that and does it really well."                            

                                Patrick Flanagan SVP of Digital Marketing and Strategy                            






    
 


                                To maintain the health of websites, it is essential to continuously monitor them. If you work with clients and they have a transactional site, like BigCommerce or Shopify, you want to know when it does down immediately. The tool also provides feedback to check the website speed, and dig deep with results that are actionable.

                                "Pingdom is a fantastic service and has helped us find problems with our site that we wouldn't have found otherwise."

                                "We use Pingdom to monitor 30+ different web endpoints in terms of uptime – both internal and 3rd party applications. We have a team of admins that monitor different services and are notified within a minute via the Pingdom app, text, and email when anything goes down. Pingdom also gives us insight into what caused the error. This is an invaluable tool!"
