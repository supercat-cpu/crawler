Technical documentation lives here

      Read the Docs simplifies software documentation by automating building, versioning, and hosting of your docs for you.
    



Free docs hosting for open source

        We will host your documentation for free, forever. There are no tricks. We help over 100,000 open source projects share their docs, including a custom domain and theme.
      


Always up to date

        Whenever you push code to your favorite version control service, whether that is GitHub, BitBucket, or GitLab, we will automatically build your docs so your code and documentation are never out of sync.
      





Downloadable formats

        We build and host your docs for the web, but they are also viewable as PDFs, as single page HTML, and for eReaders. No additional configuration is required.
      


Multiple versions

        We can host and build multiple versions of your docs so having a 1.0 version of your docs and a 2.0 version of your docs is as easy as having a separate branch or tag in your version control system.
