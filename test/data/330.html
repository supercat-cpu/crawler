Read the Docs Overview





You write docs with Sphinx or Mkdocs

          Documentation can be written in Markdown or reStructuredText.
          Write just prose documentation, or automatically pull in documentation
          written inside your code (eg. Python docstrings).
        
We build your docs on every pull request or merge

          Whenever you push a commit,
          we build your full set of documentation and provide a fully working preview.
          If you decide to merge into a production version,
          we will update it on merge.
          Your docs are always up to date with your code.
        
Everyone reads them, or you can limit access

          Expose documentation publicly to share them with the world,
          or create teams with specific granted permissions depending on their needs.
        
The same tools your team is already using

          Let your team to use their own tools to write documentation.
          Maintaining documentation is difficult,
          but using tools your team already knows makes updates easier.
          Your docs will get better, faster.
