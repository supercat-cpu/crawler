README.rst




What is lxml?
lxml is the most feature-rich and easy-to-use library for processing XML and HTML in the Python language.
It's also very fast and memory friendly, just so you know.
For an introduction and further documentation, see doc/main.txt.
For installation information, see INSTALL.txt.
For issue tracker, see https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml

Support the project
lxml has been downloaded from the Python Package Index
millions of times and is also available directly in many package
distributions, e.g. for Linux or macOS.
Most people who use lxml do so because they like using it.
You can show us that you like it by blogging about your experience
with it and linking to the project website.
If you are using lxml for your work and feel like giving a bit of
your own benefit back to support the project, consider sending us
money through GitHub Sponsors, Tidelift or PayPal that we can use
to buy us free time for the maintenance of this great library, to
fix bugs in the software, review and integrate code contributions,
to improve its features and documentation, or to just take a deep
breath and have a cup of tea every once in a while.
Please read the Legal Notice below, at the bottom of this page.
Thank you for your support.
Support lxml through GitHub Sponsors
via a Tidelift subscription
or via PayPal:

Please contact Stefan Behnel
for other ways to support the lxml project,
as well as commercial consulting, customisations and trainings on lxml and
fast Python XML processing.
Note that we are not accepting donations in crypto currencies.
Much of the development and hosting for lxml is done in a carbon-neutral way
or with compensated and very low emissions.
Crypto currencies do not fit into that ambition.
AppVeyor and GitHub Actions
support the lxml project with their build and CI servers.
Jetbrains supports the lxml project by donating free licenses of their
PyCharm IDE.
Another supporter of the lxml project is
COLOGNE Webdesign.

Project income report
lxml has more than 50 million downloads
per month on PyPI.

Total project income in 2021: EUR 4890.37  (407.53 € / month)
Tidelift: EUR 4066.66
Paypal: EUR 223.71
other: EUR 600.00


Total project income in 2020: EUR 6065,86  (506.49 € / month)
Tidelift: EUR 4064.77

Legal Notice for Donations
Any donation that you make to the lxml project is voluntary and
is not a fee for any services, goods, or advantages.  By making
a donation to the lxml project, you acknowledge that we have the
right to use the money you donate in any lawful way and for any
lawful purpose we see fit and we are not obligated to disclose
the way and purpose to any party unless required by applicable
law.  Although lxml is free software, to the best of our knowledge
the lxml project does not have any tax exempt status.  The lxml
project is neither a registered non-profit corporation nor a
registered charity in any country.  Your donation may or may not
be tax-deductible; please consult your tax advisor in this matter.
We will not publish or disclose your name and/or e-mail address
