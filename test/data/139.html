Have questions? We have answers.


What are the top sites on the network?
Our audiences section has some of the top publishers on our network for data science, DevOps, and our other main topics.


Is the platform self-serve?
During your campaign, you will get access to our advertiser platform where you can see live reporting, upload your own ads, and and turn on and off specific ads whenever you like. We will still approve and start your campaigns.




How can I measure ad performance without tracking?
Use your existing conversion tracking mechanism such as analytics and rely on UTM or ref parameters added to your ad landing page link.


What are the ad specifications?

          See our ad specs for precise details and screenshots.
