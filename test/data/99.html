Python Software Foundation


The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect,
and advance the Python programming language, and to support and
facilitate the growth of a
diverse
and international community of Python programmers.
—from the Mission Statement page

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation that
holds the intellectual property rights
behind the Python programming language. We manage the open source licensing
for Python version 2.1 and later and own and protect the trademarks associated
with Python. We also run the North American PyCon
conference annually, support other Python conferences around the world, and
fund Python related development with our grants program and by
funding special projects.
For a quick overview of the PSF's activities, please read our
Annual Impact Report. For regular updates, see our
blog.
