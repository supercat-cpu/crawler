Analyzing PyPI package downloadsÂ¶
This section covers how to use the public PyPI download statistics dataset
to learn more about downloads of a package (or packages) hosted on PyPI. For
example, you can use it to discover the distribution of Python versions used to
download a package.

BackgroundÂ¶
PyPI does not display download statistics for a number of reasons: 1

Inefficient to make work with a Content Distribution Network (CDN):
Download statistics change constantly. Including them in project pages, which
are heavily cached, would require invalidating the cache more often, and
reduce the overall effectiveness of the cache.
Highly inaccurate: A number of things prevent the download counts from
being accurate, some of which include:

pipâs download cache (lowers download counts)
Internal or unofficial mirrors (can both raise or lower download counts)
Packages not hosted on PyPI (for comparisons sake)
Unofficial scripts or attempts at download count inflation (raises download
counts)
Known historical data quality issues (lowers download counts)


Not particularly useful: Just because a project has been downloaded a lot
doesnât mean itâs good; Similarly just because a project hasnât been
downloaded a lot doesnât mean itâs bad!

In short, because itâs value is low for various reasons, and the tradeoffs
required to make it work are high, it has been not an effective use of
limited resources.


Public datasetÂ¶
As an alternative, the Linehaul project
streams download logs from PyPI to Google BigQuery 2, where they are
stored as a public dataset.

Getting set upÂ¶
In order to use Google BigQuery to query the public PyPI download
statistics dataset, youâll need a Google account and to enable the BigQuery
API on a Google Cloud Platform project. You can run the up to 1TB of queries
per month using the BigQuery free tier without a credit card

Navigate to the BigQuery web UI.
Create a new project.
Enable the BigQuery API.

For more detailed instructions on how to get started with BigQuery, check out
the BigQuery quickstart guide.


Data schemaÂ¶
Linehaul writes an entry in a bigquery-public-data.pypi.file_downloads table for each
download. The table contains information about what file was downloaded and how
it was downloaded. Some useful columns from the table schema
include:







Column
Description
Examples



timestamp
Date and time
2020-03-09 00:33:03 UTC

file.project
Project name
pipenv, nose

file.version
Package version
0.1.6, 1.4.2

details.installer.name
Installer
pip, bandersnatch

details.python
Python version
2.7.12, 3.6.4





Useful queriesÂ¶
Run queries in the BigQuery web UI by clicking the âCompose queryâ button.
Note that the rows are stored in a partitioned, which helps
limit the cost of queries. These example queries analyze downloads from
recent history by filtering on the timestamp column.

Counting package downloadsÂ¶
The following query counts the total number of downloads for the project
âpytestâ.
#standardSQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_downloads
FROM `bigquery-public-data.pypi.file_downloads`
WHERE file.project = 'pytest'
  -- Only query the last 30 days of history
  AND DATE(timestamp)
    BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
    AND CURRENT_DATE()







num_downloads



26190085



To only count downloads from pip, filter on the details.installer.name
column.
#standardSQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_downloads
FROM `bigquery-public-data.pypi.file_downloads`
WHERE file.project = 'pytest'
  AND details.installer.name = 'pip'
  -- Only query the last 30 days of history
  AND DATE(timestamp)
    BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
    AND CURRENT_DATE()







num_downloads



24334215





Package downloads over timeÂ¶
To group by monthly downloads, use the TIMESTAMP_TRUNC function. Also
filtering by this column reduces corresponding costs.
#standardSQL
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS num_downloads,
  DATE_TRUNC(DATE(timestamp), MONTH) AS `month`
FROM `bigquery-public-data.pypi.file_downloads`
WHERE
  file.project = 'pytest'
  -- Only query the last 6 months of history
  AND DATE(timestamp)
    BETWEEN DATE_TRUNC(DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH), MONTH)
    AND CURRENT_DATE()
GROUP BY `month`
ORDER BY `month` DESC








num_downloads
month

2017-09-01

1916952
2017-08-01





Python versions over timeÂ¶
Extract the Python version from the details.python column. Warning: This
query processes over 500 GB of data.
#standardSQL
SELECT
  REGEXP_EXTRACT(details.python, r"[0-9]+\.[0-9]+") AS python_version,
  COUNT(*) AS num_downloads,
FROM `bigquery-public-data.pypi.file_downloads`
WHERE
  -- Only query the last 6 months of history
  DATE(timestamp)
    BETWEEN DATE_TRUNC(DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH), MONTH)
    AND CURRENT_DATE()
GROUP BY `python_version`
ORDER BY `num_downloads` DESC

CaveatsÂ¶
In addition to the caveats listed in the background above, Linehaul suffered
from a bug which caused it to significantly under-report download statistics
prior to July 26, 2018. Downloads before this date are proportionally accurate
(e.g. the percentage of Python 2 vs. Python 3 downloads) but total numbers are
lower than actual by an order of magnitude.


Additional toolsÂ¶
Besides using the BigQuery console, there are some additional tools which may
be useful when analyzing download statistics.

google-cloud-bigqueryÂ¶
You can also access the public PyPI download statistics dataset
programmatically via the BigQuery API and the google-cloud-bigquery project,
the official Python client library for BigQuery.
from google.cloud import bigquery

# Note: depending on where this code is being run, you may require
# additional authentication. See:
# https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/authentication/
client = bigquery.Client()

query_job = client.query("""
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_downloads
FROM `bigquery-public-data.pypi.file_downloads`
WHERE file.project = 'pytest'
  -- Only query the last 30 days of history
  AND DATE(timestamp)
    BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
    AND CURRENT_DATE()""")

results = query_job.result()  # Waits for job to complete.
for row in results:
    print("{} downloads".format(row.num_downloads))




pypinfoÂ¶
pypinfo is a command-line tool which provides access to the dataset and
can generate several useful queries. For example, you can query the total
number of download for a package with the command pypinfo package_name.
Install pypinfo using pip.
python -m pip install pypinfo


Usage:
$ pypinfo requests
Served from cache: False
Data processed: 6.87 GiB
Data billed: 6.87 GiB
Estimated cost: $0.04

| download_count |
| -------------- |
|      9,316,415 |




pandas-gbqÂ¶
The pandas-gbq project allows for accessing query results via Pandas.
