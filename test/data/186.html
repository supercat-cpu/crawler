                    I'm in the unique position of asking over 100 industry experts the following question on my Talk
                    Python To Me podcast. "When you write some Python code, what editor do you open up?" While the
                    answers vary, it is frequently PyCharm. The reasons the guests give are usually the same reasons
                    I've been a PyCharm advocate for years.
                

PyCharm deeply understands your project, not just individual files
Refactoring is a breeze across an entire project
The built-in SQL tooling is amazing
Autocomplete works better than any other editor, by far

That's just a few reasons I open PyCharm daily to build my web properties and manage the software that runs my business.

                        PyCharm is the best IDE I've ever used. With PyCharm, you can access the command line, connect to a database, create a virtual environment, and manage your version control system all in one place, saving time by avoiding constantly switching between windows. I couldn't imagine going back to programming without PyCharm's local history feature and debugger. Add the rest of its convenient shortcuts and features, and you have the perfect IDE.

Code insight for marking individual TypedDict items as required or potentially missing

                        PyCharm 2022.2 understands Required[ ] and NotRequired[ ] notations
