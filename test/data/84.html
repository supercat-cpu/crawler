Mobile Screen Scraping with BeautifulSoup and Python for Series 60
Posted: March 28th, 2005 | Author: Matt Croydon | Filed under: Mobile, Projects, Python, Web Services  | 65 Comments ¬ª
 
I haven‚Äôt had enough time to work up a proper hack for this, but I though I would pass along an interesting discovery that I made the other day before heading out to PyCon.  After hearing about how great BeautifulSoup is at scraping HTML and making it easy to get little bits from it that you need, I thought I‚Äôd have a go at running it on my taco.  You know what?  It worked.  I was expecting it to barf on import, but no, it chugged along just fine.
Now unfortunately BeautifulSoup won‚Äôt work out of the box with the standard .SIS install of Python for Series 60.  It relies only on SGMLParser, string, and types, but those three libraries have some dependencies themselves.  Here is what BeautifulSoup requires according to modulefinder.py running on my Debian box:

array
copy_reg
markupbase
re
sgmllib
sre
sre_compile
sre_constraints
sre_parse
string
strop
sys
types

These dependencies can be easily taken care of by dropping the python modules from the source distro in the appropriate libs directory on the drive you installed Python on.
One reason that BeautfulSoup ‚Äújust works‚Äù on Series 60 is that the author strives to keep imports to a minimum and that the author srives to keep BeautifulSoup backwards compatible all the way back to Python 1.5.2.  There are probably many modules out there like BeautifulSoup that are designed to be backwards compatible and platform independent that should work just fine on Series 60.  As I find them, I will definitely point them out.  I also hope to do some hacking on a few screen scraping apps that use BeautifulSoup and appuifw to present web data using native widgets.

Unquestionably believe that which you said. Your favorite justification seemed to be on the internet the simplest thing to be aware of. I say to you, I definitely get annoyed while people consider worries that they plainly don‚Äôt know about. You managed to hit the nail upon the top and defined out the whole thing without having side effect , people can take a signal. Will probably be back to get more. Thanks

An interesting discussion is worth comment. I think that you should write more on this topic, it might not be a taboo subject but generally people are not enough to speak on such topics. To the next. Cheers

This is some agreeable material. It took me some time to locate this site but it was worth the time. I noticed this content was buried in yahoo and not the number one spot. This weblog has a ton of decent stuff and it doesn‚Äôt deserve to be burried in the searches like that. By the way I‚Äôm going  to save this site to my favorites.

You really make it seem so easy with your presentation but I find this matter to be actually something that I think I would never understand. It seems too complicated and extremely broad for me. I‚Äôm looking forward for your next post, I will try to get the hang of it!
