snide/README.md


Hello, I'm Dave üëã
Hello random visitor. My name is Dave Snider. I've been working with computers in some form or another since the early 90s when I hacked away on an old IBM PS2 and a pre-www Prodigy account. Since then I've mostly fiddled around on the Internet building websites for myself, Elastic, CNET, or CBS. Right now I work at iRacing as a UX designer.
I enjoy designing through code and these days start most projects with a commit rather than a mock. I love open source, and tend to contribute or sponsor anything I personally use. My daily tools are:

Arch Linux with i3 window manager is my desktop
Neovim is my editor
Fish is shell
Alacritty for a terminal
For navigating around I enjoy nnn, fzf, and bat

You might know me from these open source projects:

Elastic UI - The React design system that powers Elastic.
Kibana - Charts and things!
Webhook CMS - An early (2013!) Jamstack (This wasn't even a word yet!) CMS you can reminisce about on Vimeo.
Read the Docs - I get a kick that my theme work powers the Linux kernal docs.

For you video game nerds, I am also that Dave Snider from Giant Bomb (the website about videogames). You can read more about what I'm up to on my personal website.
