pip install#

Usage#

Unix/macOS
python -m pip install [options] <requirement specifier> [package-index-options] ...
python -m pip install [options] -r <requirements file> [package-index-options] ...
python -m pip install [options] [-e] <vcs project url> ...
python -m pip install [options] [-e] <local project path> ...
python -m pip install [options] <archive url/path> ...



Windows
py -m pip install [options] <requirement specifier> [package-index-options] ...
py -m pip install [options] -r <requirements file> [package-index-options] ...
py -m pip install [options] [-e] <vcs project url> ...
py -m pip install [options] [-e] <local project path> ...
py -m pip install [options] <archive url/path> ...






Description#
Install packages from:

PyPI (and other indexes) using requirement specifiers.
VCS project urls.
Local project directories.
Local or remote source archives.

pip also supports installing from ârequirements filesâ, which provide
an easy way to specify a whole environment to be installed.


Overview#
pip install has several stages:

Identify the base requirements. The user supplied arguments are processed
here.
Resolve dependencies. What will be installed is determined here.
Build wheels. All the dependencies that can be are built into wheels.
Install the packages (and uninstall anything being upgraded/replaced).

Note that pip install prefers to leave the installed version as-is
unless --upgrade is specified.


Argument Handling#
When looking at the items to be installed, pip checks what type of item
each is, in the following order:

Project or archive URL.
Local directory (which must contain a setup.py, or pip will report
an error).
Local file (a sdist or wheel format archive, following the naming
conventions for those formats).
A requirement, as specified in PEP 440.

Each item identified is added to the set of requirements to be satisfied by
the install.


Working Out the Name and Version#
For each candidate item, pip needs to know the project name and version. For
wheels (identified by the .whl file extension) this can be obtained from
the filename, as per the Wheel spec. For local directories, or explicitly
specified sdist files, the setup.py egg_info command is used to determine
the project metadata. For sdists located via an index, the filename is parsed
for the name and project version (this is in theory slightly less reliable
than using the egg_info command, but avoids downloading and processing
unnecessary numbers of files).
Any URL may use the #egg=name syntax (see VCS Support) to
explicitly state the project name.


Satisfying Requirements#
Once pip has the set of requirements to satisfy, it chooses which version of
each requirement to install using the simple rule that the latest version that
satisfies the given constraints will be installed (but see here
for an exception regarding pre-release versions). Where more than one source of
the chosen version is available, it is assumed that any source is acceptable
(as otherwise the versions would differ).


Obtaining information about what was installed#
The install command has a --report option that will generate a JSON report of what
pip has installed. In combination with the --dry-run and --ignore-installed it
can be used to resolve a set of requirements without actually installing them.
The report can be written to a file, or to standard output (using --report - in
combination with --quiet).
The format of the JSON report is described in Installation Report.


Installation Order#

Note
This section is only about installation order of runtime dependencies, and
does not apply to build dependencies (those are specified using PEP 518).

As of v6.1.0, pip installs dependencies before their dependents, i.e. in
âtopological order.â  This is the only commitment pip currently makes related
to order.  While it may be coincidentally true that pip will install things in
the order of the install arguments or in the order of the items in a
requirements file, this is not a promise.
In the event of a dependency cycle (aka âcircular dependencyâ), the current
implementation (which might possibly change later) has it such that the first
encountered member of the cycle is installed last.
For instance, if quux depends on foo which depends on bar which depends on baz,
which depends on foo:

Unix/macOS
$ python -m pip install quux
...
Installing collected packages baz, bar, foo, quux

$ python -m pip install bar
...
Installing collected packages foo, baz, bar



Windows
C:\> py -m pip install quux
...
Installing collected packages baz, bar, foo, quux

C:\> py -m pip install bar
...
Installing collected packages foo, baz, bar




Prior to v6.1.0, pip made no commitments about install order.
The decision to install topologically is based on the principle that
installations should proceed in a way that leaves the environment usable at each
step. This has two main practical benefits:

Concurrent use of the environment during the install is more likely to work.
A failed install is less likely to leave a broken environment.  Although pip
would like to support failure rollbacks eventually, in the mean time, this is
an improvement.

Although the new install order is not intended to replace (and does not replace)
the use of setup_requires to declare build dependencies, it may help certain
projects install from sdist (that might previously fail) that fit the following
profile:

They have build dependencies that are also declared as install dependencies
using install_requires.
python setup.py egg_info works without their build dependencies being
installed.
For whatever reason, they donât or wonât declare their build dependencies using
setup_requires.

Requirements File Format
This section has been moved to Requirements File Format.
Requirement Specifiers
This section has been moved to Requirement Specifiers.
Per-requirement Overrides
This is now covered in Requirements File Format.


Pre-release Versions#
Starting with v1.4, pip will only install stable versions as specified by
pre-releases by default. If a version cannot be parsed as a compliant PEP 440
version then it is assumed to be a pre-release.
If a Requirement specifier includes a pre-release or development version
(e.g. >=0.0.dev0) then pip will allow pre-release and development versions
for that requirement. This does not include the != flag.
The pip install command also supports a --pre flag
that enables installation of pre-releases and development releases.
VCS Support
This is now covered in VCS Support.


Finding Packages#
pip searches for packages on PyPI using the
HTTP simple interface,
which is documented here
and there.
pip offers a number of package index options for modifying how packages are
found.
pip looks for packages in a number of places: on PyPI (if not disabled via
--no-index), in the local filesystem, and in any additional repositories
specified via --find-links or --index-url. There is no ordering in
the locations that are searched. Rather they are all checked, and the âbestâ
match for the requirements (in terms of version number - see PEP 440 for
details) is selected.
See the pip install Examples.


SSL Certificate Verification#
Starting with v1.3, pip provides SSL certificate verification over HTTP, to
prevent man-in-the-middle attacks against PyPI downloads. This does not use
the system certificate store but instead uses a bundled CA certificate
store. The default bundled CA certificate store certificate store may be
overridden by using --cert option or by using PIP_CERT,
REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE, or CURL_CA_BUNDLE environment variables.
Caching
This is now covered in Caching.
Wheel Cache
This is now covered in Caching.
Hash checking mode
This is now covered in Secure installs.
Local Project Installs
This is now covered in Local project installs.
Editable installs
This is now covered in Local project installs.
Build System Interface
This is now covered in Build System Interface.



Options#


-r, --requirement <file>#
Install from the given requirements file. This option can be used multiple times.



-c, --constraint <file>#
Constrain versions using the given constraints file. This option can be used multiple times.



--no-deps#
Donât install package dependencies.



--pre#
Include pre-release and development versions. By default, pip only finds stable versions.



-e, --editable <path/url>#
Install a project in editable mode (i.e. setuptools âdevelop modeâ) from a local project path or a VCS url.



--dry-run#
Donât actually install anything, just print what would be. Can be used in combination with --ignore-installed to âresolveâ the requirements.



-t, --target <dir>#
Install packages into <dir>. By default this will not replace existing files/folders in <dir>. Use --upgrade to replace existing packages in <dir> with new versions.



--platform <platform>#
Only use wheels compatible with <platform>. Defaults to the platform of the running system. Use this option multiple times to specify multiple platforms supported by the target interpreter.



--python-version <python_version>#
The Python interpreter version to use for wheel and âRequires-Pythonâ
compatibility checks. Defaults to a version derived from the running
interpreter. The version can be specified using up to three dot-separated
integers (e.g. â3â for 3.0.0, â3.7â for 3.7.0, or â3.7.3â). A major-minor
version can also be given as a string without dots (e.g. â37â for 3.7.0).



--implementation <implementation>#
Only use wheels compatible with Python implementation <implementation>, e.g. âppâ, âjyâ, âcpâ,  or âipâ. If not specified, then the current interpreter implementation is used.  Use âpyâ to force implementation-agnostic wheels.



--abi <abi>#
Only use wheels compatible with Python abi <abi>, e.g. âpypy_41â. If not specified, then the current interpreter abi tag is used. Use this option multiple times to specify multiple abis supported by the target interpreter. Generally you will need to specify --implementation, --platform, and --python-version when using this option.



--user#
Install to the Python user install directory for your platform. Typically ~/.local/, or %APPDATA%Python on Windows. (See the Python documentation for site.USER_BASE for full details.)



--root <dir>#
Install everything relative to this alternate root directory.



--prefix <dir>#
Installation prefix where lib, bin and other top-level folders are placed



--src <dir>#
Directory to check out editable projects into. The default in a virtualenv is â<venv path>/srcâ. The default for global installs is â<current dir>/srcâ.



-U, --upgrade#
Upgrade all specified packages to the newest available version. The handling of dependencies depends on the upgrade-strategy used.



--upgrade-strategy <upgrade_strategy>#
Determines how dependency upgrading should be handled [default: only-if-needed]. âeagerâ - dependencies are upgraded regardless of whether the currently installed version satisfies the requirements of the upgraded package(s). âonly-if-neededâ -  are upgraded only when they do not satisfy the requirements of the upgraded package(s).



--force-reinstall#
Reinstall all packages even if they are already up-to-date.



-I, --ignore-installed#
Ignore the installed packages, overwriting them. This can break your system if the existing package is of a different version or was installed with a different package manager!



--ignore-requires-python#
Ignore the Requires-Python information.



--no-build-isolation#
Disable isolation when building a modern source distribution. Build dependencies specified by PEP 518 must be already installed if this option is used.



--use-pep517#
Use PEP 517 for building source distributions (use --no-use-pep517 to force legacy behaviour).



--check-build-dependencies#
Check the build dependencies when PEP517 is used.



--config-settings <settings>#
Configuration settings to be passed to the PEP 517 build backend. Settings take the form KEY=VALUE. Use multiple --config-settings options to pass multiple keys to the backend.



--install-option <options>#
Extra arguments to be supplied to the setup.py install command (use like --install-option=â--install-scripts=/usr/local/binâ). Use multiple --install-option options to pass multiple options to setup.py install. If you are using an option with a directory path, be sure to use absolute path.



--global-option <options>#
Extra global options to be supplied to the setup.py call before the install or bdist_wheel command.



--compile#
Compile Python source files to bytecode



--no-compile#
Do not compile Python source files to bytecode



--no-warn-script-location#
Do not warn when installing scripts outside PATH



--no-warn-conflicts#
Do not warn about broken dependencies



--no-binary <format_control>#
Do not use binary packages. Can be supplied multiple times, and each time adds to the existing value. Accepts either â:all:â to disable all binary packages, â:none:â to empty the set (notice the colons), or one or more package names with commas between them (no colons). Note that some packages are tricky to compile and may fail to install when this option is used on them.



--only-binary <format_control>#
Do not use source packages. Can be supplied multiple times, and each time adds to the existing value. Accepts either â:all:â to disable all source packages, â:none:â to empty the set, or one or more package names with commas between them. Packages without binary distributions will fail to install when this option is used on them.



--prefer-binary#
Prefer older binary packages over newer source packages.



--require-hashes#
Require a hash to check each requirement against, for repeatable installs. This option is implied when any package in a requirements file has a --hash option.



--progress-bar <progress_bar>#
Specify whether the progress bar should be used [on, off] (default: on)



--root-user-action <root_user_action>#
Action if pip is run as a root user. By default, a warning message is shown.



--report <file>#
Generate a JSON file describing what pip did to install the provided requirements. Can be used in combination with --dry-run and --ignore-installed to âresolveâ the requirements. When - is used as file name it writes to stdout.



--no-clean#
Donât clean up build directories.




-i, --index-url <url>#
Base URL of the Python Package Index (default https://pypi.org/simple). This should point to a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API) or a local directory laid out in the same format.



--extra-index-url <url>#
Extra URLs of package indexes to use in addition to --index-url. Should follow the same rules as --index-url.



--no-index#
Ignore package index (only looking at --find-links URLs instead).



-f, --find-links <url>#
If a URL or path to an html file, then parse for links to archives such as sdist (.tar.gz) or wheel (.whl) files. If a local path or file:// URL thatâs a directory, then look for archives in the directory listing. Links to VCS project URLs are not supported.




Examples#

Install SomePackage and its dependencies from PyPI using Requirement Specifiers

Unix/macOS
python -m pip install SomePackage            # latest version
python -m pip install SomePackage==1.0.4     # specific version
python -m pip install 'SomePackage>=1.0.4'   # minimum version



Windows
py -m pip install SomePackage            # latest version
py -m pip install SomePackage==1.0.4     # specific version
py -m pip install 'SomePackage>=1.0.4'   # minimum version





Install a list of requirements specified in a file.  See the Requirements files.

Unix/macOS
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt



Windows
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt





Upgrade an already installed SomePackage to the latest from PyPI.

Unix/macOS
python -m pip install --upgrade SomePackage



Windows

py -m pip install --upgrade SomePackage




Note
This will guarantee an update to SomePackage as it is a direct
requirement, and possibly upgrade dependencies if their installed
versions do not meet the minimum requirements of SomePackage.
Any non-requisite updates of its dependencies (indirect requirements)
will be affected by the --upgrade-strategy command.

py -m pip install -e svn+svn://svn.repo/some_pkg/trunk/#egg=SomePackage         # from svn
py -m pip install -e git+https://git.repo/some_pkg.git@feature#egg=SomePackage  # from 'feature' branch
py -m pip install -e "git+https://git.repo/some_repo.git#egg=subdir&subdirectory=subdir_path" # install a python package from a repo subdirectory





Install a package with extras.

py -m pip install SomePackage[PDF]==3.0
py -m pip install SomePackage[PDF,EPUB]  # multiple extras





Install a particular source archive file.

Unix/macOS
python -m pip install ./downloads/SomePackage-1.0.4.tar.gz
python -m pip install http://my.package.repo/SomePackage-1.0.4.zip



Windows
py -m pip install ./downloads/SomePackage-1.0.4.tar.gz
py -m pip install http://my.package.repo/SomePackage-1.0.4.zip





Install a particular source archive file following PEP 440 direct references.

Unix/macOS
python -m pip install SomeProject@http://my.package.repo/SomeProject-1.2.3-py33-none-any.whl
python -m pip install "SomeProject @ http://my.package.repo/SomeProject-1.2.3-py33-none-any.whl"
python -m pip install SomeProject@http://my.package.repo/1.2.3.tar.gz



Windows
py -m pip install SomeProject@http://my.package.repo/SomeProject-1.2.3-py33-none-any.whl
py -m pip install "SomeProject @ http://my.package.repo/SomeProject-1.2.3-py33-none-any.whl"
py -m pip install SomeProject@http://my.package.repo/1.2.3.tar.gz





Install from alternative package repositories.
Install from a different index, and not PyPI

Unix/macOS
python -m pip install --index-url http://my.package.repo/simple/ SomePackage



Windows
py -m pip install --index-url http://my.package.repo/simple/ SomePackage




Install from a local flat directory containing archives (and donât scan indexes):

Unix/macOS
python -m pip install --no-index --find-links=file:///local/dir/ SomePackage
python -m pip install --no-index --find-links=/local/dir/ SomePackage
python -m pip install --no-index --find-links=relative/dir/ SomePackage



Windows
py -m pip install --no-index --find-links=file:///local/dir/ SomePackage
py -m pip install --no-index --find-links=/local/dir/ SomePackage
py -m pip install --no-index --find-links=relative/dir/ SomePackage




Search an additional index during install, in addition to PyPI

Warning
Using this option to search for packages which are not in the main
repository (such as private packages) is unsafe, per a security
vulnerability called
dependency confusion:
an attacker can claim the package on the public repository in a way that
will ensure it gets chosen over the private package.


Unix/macOS
python -m pip install --extra-index-url http://my.package.repo/simple SomePackage



Windows
py -m pip install --extra-index-url http://my.package.repo/simple SomePackage





Find pre-release and development versions, in addition to stable versions.  By default, pip only finds stable versions.

Unix/macOS
python -m pip install --pre SomePackage



Windows
py -m pip install --pre SomePackage





Install packages from source.
Do not use any binary packages

Unix/macOS
python -m pip install SomePackage1 SomePackage2 --no-binary :all:



Windows
py -m pip install SomePackage1 SomePackage2 --no-binary :all:




Specify SomePackage1 to be installed from source:

Unix/macOS
python -m pip install SomePackage1 SomePackage2 --no-binary SomePackage1



Windows
py -m pip install SomePackage1 SomePackage2 --no-binary SomePackage1
