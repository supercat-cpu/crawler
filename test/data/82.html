        Products
      

        We embody the shift toward investments in safe and secure software design practices with our world-class security engineering program. We embed security expertise and capabilities into every phase of our Software Development Lifecycle.
      

        Our Product Security Engineering team empowers developers to  create a secure platform and products. Through developer training, the creation of components that form a secure foundation to build on, automated code analysis, in-depth threat modeling, and security code review and testing, we prevent vulnerabilities as early as possible in the development lifecycle.
      

        Once our product is out the door, our security testing doesn’t stop. In addition to our internal Red Team, we leverage the collective expertise of the security research community through our Bug Bounty program to provide ongoing and broadly-scoped review.
