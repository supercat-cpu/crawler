Docutils: Documentation Utilities
Written in Python, for General- and Special-Purpose Use
Docutils is an open-source text processing system for processing
plaintext documentation into useful formats, such as HTML, LaTeX,
man-pages, OpenDocument, or XML.
It includes reStructuredText, the easy to read, easy to use,
what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup language.


Overview
To get up & running quickly, see the Quick-Start section of the
README file. The only requirement for running Docutils is Python.
All documentation can be reached from the Project Documentation
Overview. If something is unclear or missing, ask at the
docutils-users mailing list.
The  project page has links to the tracker, mailing
lists, and code repository.
All discussion about Docutils takes place on the mailing lists.
To the developers of an open source project, feedback is a great
motivator and is very welcome.  We also rely on feedback for
determining what features to implement.  Thus, if you tell us what you
need, we may help!  Please post any feedback to the
docutils-users mailing list.
If you find a bug, please file a bug report or mail to the
docutils-users mailing list.
We welcome all kinds of contributions.  There's a To Do list full
of ideas awaiting a champion.  If you have any questions regarding how to
extend Docutils, please feel free to ask on the docutils-develop mailing
list. Patch submissions should be filed in the patch tracker
(preferred) or sent to docutils-develop.


Download
Release packages can be downloaded from PyPI.
See the release notes for a list of changes since the previous
release.
Snapshots [1] from the Docutils' Subversion repository
usually contain more features and fewer bugs
than the "official" releasesâthey're not only for developers!

[1]
Snapshots are created on-demand by Sourceforge.  You can
download a snapshot of the complete trunk directory (docutils,
sandbox, prest/perl and web) or any sub-directory. Browse to the
desired directory and click the "Download Snapshot" button.
