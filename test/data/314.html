Installing PackagesÂ¶
This section covers the basics of how to install Python packages.
Itâs important to note that the term âpackageâ in this context is being used to
describe a bundle of software to be installed (i.e. as a synonym for a
distribution). It does not to refer to the kind
of package that you import in your Python source code
(i.e. a container of modules). It is common in the Python community to refer to
a distribution using the term âpackageâ.  Using
the term âdistributionâ is often not preferred, because it can easily be
confused with a Linux distribution, or another larger software distribution
like Python itself.

Requirements for Installing PackagesÂ¶
This section describes the steps to follow before installing other Python
packages.

Ensure you can run Python from the command lineÂ¶
Before you go any further, make sure you have Python and that the expected
version is available from your command line. You can check this by running:

Unix/macOS
python3 --version



Windows
py --version




You should get some output like Python 3.6.3. If you do not have Python,
please install the latest 3.x version from python.org or refer to the
Installing Python section of the Hitchhikerâs Guide to Python.

Note
If youâre a newcomer and you get an error like this:
>>> python --version
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'python' is not defined


Itâs because this command and other suggested commands in this tutorial
are intended to be run in a shell (also called a terminal or
console). See the Python for Beginners getting started tutorial for
an introduction to using your operating systemâs shell and interacting with
Python.


Note
If youâre using an enhanced shell like IPython or the Jupyter
notebook, you can run system commands like those in this tutorial by
prefacing them with a ! character:

In [1]: import sys
        !{sys.executable} --version
Python 3.6.3



Itâs recommended to write {sys.executable} rather than plain python in
order to ensure that commands are run in the Python installation matching
the currently running notebook (which may not be the same Python
installation that the python command refers to).


Note
Due to the way most Linux distributions are handling the Python 3
migration, Linux users using the system Python without creating a virtual
environment first should replace the python command in this tutorial
with python3 and the python -m pip command with python3 -m pip --user. Do not
run any of the commands in this tutorial with sudo: if you get a
permissions error, come back to the section on creating virtual environments,
set one up, and then continue with the tutorial as written.



Ensure you can run pip from the command lineÂ¶
Additionally, youâll need to make sure you have pip available. You can
check this by running:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip --version



Windows
py -m pip --version




If you installed Python from source, with an installer from python.org, or
via Homebrew you should already have pip. If youâre on Linux and installed
using your OS package manager, you may have to install pip separately, see
Installing pip/setuptools/wheel with Linux Package Managers.
If pip isnât already installed, then first try to bootstrap it from the
standard library:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m ensurepip --default-pip



Windows
py -m ensurepip --default-pip




If that still doesnât allow you to run python -m pip:


Securely Download get-pip.py 1
Run python get-pip.py. 2  This will install or upgrade pip.
Additionally, it will install setuptools and wheel if theyâre
not installed already.

Warning
Be cautious if youâre using a Python install thatâs managed by your
operating system or another package manager. get-pip.py does not
coordinate with those tools, and may leave your system in an
inconsistent state. You can use python get-pip.py --prefix=/usr/local/
to install in /usr/local which is designed for locally-installed
software.






Ensure pip, setuptools, and wheel are up to dateÂ¶
While pip alone is sufficient to install from pre-built binary archives,
up to date copies of the setuptools and wheel projects are useful
to ensure you can also install from source archives:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel



Windows
py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel






Optionally, create a virtual environmentÂ¶
See section below for details,
but hereâs the basic venv 3 command to use on a typical Linux system:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m venv tutorial_env
source tutorial_env/bin/activate



Windows
py -m venv tutorial_env
tutorial_env\Scripts\activate




This will create a new virtual environment in the tutorial_env subdirectory,
and configure the current shell to use it as the default python environment.



Creating Virtual EnvironmentsÂ¶
Python âVirtual Environmentsâ allow Python packages to be installed in an isolated location for a particular application,
rather than being installed globally. If you are looking to safely install
global command line tools,
see Installing stand alone command line tools.
Imagine you have an application that needs version 1 of LibFoo, but another
application requires version 2. How can you use both these applications? If you
install everything into /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages (or whatever your
platformâs standard location is), itâs easy to end up in a situation where you
unintentionally upgrade an application that shouldnât be upgraded.
Or more generally, what if you want to install an application and leave it be?
If an application works, any change in its libraries or the versions of those
libraries can break the application.
Also, what if you canât install packages into the
global site-packages directory? For instance, on a shared host.
In all these cases, virtual environments can help you. They have their own
installation directories and they donât share libraries with other virtual
environments.
Currently, there are two common tools for creating Python virtual environments:

venv is available by default in Python 3.3 and later, and installs
pip and setuptools into created virtual environments in
Python 3.4 and later.
virtualenv needs to be installed separately, but supports Python 2.7+
and Python 3.3+, and pip, setuptools and wheel are
always installed into created virtual environments by default (regardless of
Python version).

The basic usage is like so:
Using venv:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m venv <DIR>
source <DIR>/bin/activate



Windows
py -m venv <DIR>
<DIR>\Scripts\activate




Using virtualenv:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m virtualenv <DIR>
source <DIR>/bin/activate



Windows
virtualenv <DIR>
<DIR>\Scripts\activate




For more information, see the venv docs or
the virtualenv docs.
The use of source under Unix shells ensures
that the virtual environmentâs variables are set within the current
shell, and not in a subprocess (which then disappears, having no
useful effect).
In both of the above cases, Windows users should _not_ use the
source command, but should rather run the activate
script directly from the command shell like so:
<DIR>\Scripts\activate


Managing multiple virtual environments directly can become tedious, so the
dependency management tutorial introduces a
higher level tool, Pipenv, that automatically manages a separate
virtual environment for each project and application that you work on.


Use pip for InstallingÂ¶
pip is the recommended installer.  Below, weâll cover the most common
usage scenarios. For more detail, see the pip docs,
which includes a complete Reference Guide.


Installing from PyPIÂ¶
The most common usage of pip is to install from the Python Package
Index using a requirement specifier. Generally speaking, a requirement specifier is
composed of a project name followed by an optional version specifier.  PEP 440 contains a full
specification
of the currently supported specifiers. Below are some examples.
To install the latest version of âSomeProjectâ:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install "SomeProject"



Windows
py -m pip install "SomeProject"




To install a specific version:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install "SomeProject==1.4"



Windows
py -m pip install "SomeProject==1.4"




To install greater than or equal to one version and less than another:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install "SomeProject>=1,<2"



Windows
py -m pip install "SomeProject>=1,<2"




To install a version thatâs âcompatibleâ
with a certain version: 4

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install "SomeProject~=1.4.2"



Windows
py -m pip install "SomeProject~=1.4.2"




In this case, this means to install any version â==1.4.*â version thatâs also
â>=1.4.2â.


Source Distributions vs WheelsÂ¶
pip can install from either Source Distributions (sdist) or Wheels, but if both are present
on PyPI, pip will prefer a compatible wheel. You can override
pip`s default behavior by e.g. using its âno-binary option.
Wheels are a pre-built distribution format that provides faster installation compared to Source
Distributions (sdist), especially when a
project contains compiled extensions.
If pip does not find a wheel to install, it will locally build a wheel
and cache it for future installs, instead of rebuilding the source distribution
in the future.


Upgrading packagesÂ¶
Upgrade an already installed SomeProject to the latest from PyPI.

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install --upgrade SomeProject



Windows
py -m pip install --upgrade SomeProject






Installing to the User SiteÂ¶
To install packages that are isolated to the
current user, use the --user flag:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install --user SomeProject



Windows
py -m pip install --user SomeProject




For more information see the User Installs section
from the pip docs.
Note that the --user flag has no effect when inside a virtual environment
- all installation commands will affect the virtual environment.
If SomeProject defines any command-line scripts or console entry points,
--user will cause them to be installed inside the user baseâs binary
directory, which may or may not already be present in your shellâs
PATH.  (Starting in version 10, pip displays a warning when
installing any scripts to a directory outside PATH.)  If the scripts
are not available in your shell after installation, youâll need to add the
directory to your PATH:

On Linux and macOS you can find the user base binary directory by running
python -m site --user-base and adding bin to the end. For example,
this will typically print ~/.local (with ~ expanded to the absolute
path to your home directory) so youâll need to add ~/.local/bin to your
PATH.  You can set your PATH permanently by modifying ~/.profile.
On Windows you can find the user base binary directory by running py -m
site --user-site and replacing site-packages with Scripts. For
example, this could return
C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Python36\site-packages so you would
need to set your PATH to include
C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Python36\Scripts. You can set your user
PATH permanently in the Control Panel. You may need to log out for the
PATH changes to take effect.



Requirements filesÂ¶
Install a list of requirements specified in a Requirements File.

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt



Windows
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt






Installing from VCSÂ¶
Install a project from VCS in âeditableâ mode.  For a full breakdown of the
syntax, see pipâs section on VCS Support.

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install -e git+https://git.repo/some_pkg.git#egg=SomeProject          # from git
python3 -m pip install -e hg+https://hg.repo/some_pkg#egg=SomeProject                # from mercurial
python3 -m pip install -e svn+svn://svn.repo/some_pkg/trunk/#egg=SomeProject         # from svn
python3 -m pip install -e git+https://git.repo/some_pkg.git@feature#egg=SomeProject  # from a branch



Windows
py -m pip install -e git+https://git.repo/some_pkg.git#egg=SomeProject          # from git
py -m pip install -e hg+https://hg.repo/some_pkg#egg=SomeProject                # from mercurial
py -m pip install -e svn+svn://svn.repo/some_pkg/trunk/#egg=SomeProject         # from svn
py -m pip install -e git+https://git.repo/some_pkg.git@feature#egg=SomeProject  # from a branch






Installing from other IndexesÂ¶
Install from an alternate index

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install --index-url http://my.package.repo/simple/ SomeProject



Windows
py -m pip install --index-url http://my.package.repo/simple/ SomeProject




Search an additional index during install, in addition to PyPI

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install --extra-index-url http://my.package.repo/simple SomeProject



Windows
py -m pip install --extra-index-url http://my.package.repo/simple SomeProject






Installing from a local src treeÂ¶
Installing from local src in
Development Mode,
i.e. in such a way that the project appears to be installed, but yet is
still editable from the src tree.

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install -e <path>



Windows
py -m pip install -e <path>




You can also install normally from src

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install <path>



Windows
py -m pip install <path>






Installing from local archivesÂ¶
Install a particular source archive file.

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install ./downloads/SomeProject-1.0.4.tar.gz



Windows
py -m pip install ./downloads/SomeProject-1.0.4.tar.gz




Install from a local directory containing archives (and donât check PyPI)

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install --no-index --find-links=file:///local/dir/ SomeProject
python3 -m pip install --no-index --find-links=/local/dir/ SomeProject
python3 -m pip install --no-index --find-links=relative/dir/ SomeProject



Windows
py -m pip install --no-index --find-links=file:///local/dir/ SomeProject
py -m pip install --no-index --find-links=/local/dir/ SomeProject
py -m pip install --no-index --find-links=relative/dir/ SomeProject






Installing from other sourcesÂ¶
To install from other data sources (for example Amazon S3 storage) you can
create a helper application that presents the data in a PEP 503 compliant
index format, and use the --extra-index-url flag to direct pip to use
that index.
./s3helper --port=7777
python -m pip install --extra-index-url http://localhost:7777 SomeProject




Installing PrereleasesÂ¶
Find pre-release and development versions, in addition to stable versions.  By
default, pip only finds stable versions.

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install --pre SomeProject



Windows
py -m pip install --pre SomeProject






Installing âExtrasâÂ¶
Extras are optional âvariantsâ of a package, which may include
additional dependencies, and thereby enable additional functionality
from the package.  If you wish to install an extra for a package which
you know publishes one, you can include it in the pip installation command:

Unix/macOS
python3 -m pip install SomePackage[PDF]
python3 -m pip install SomePackage[PDF]==3.0
python3 -m pip install -e .[PDF]  # editable project in current directory



Windows
py -m pip install SomePackage[PDF]
py -m pip install SomePackage[PDF]==3.0
py -m pip install -e .[PDF]  # editable project in current directory






1
âSecureâ in this context means using a modern browser or a
tool like curl that verifies SSL certificates when
downloading from https URLs.

2
Depending on your platform, this may require root or Administrator
access. pip is currently considering changing this by making user
installs the default behavior.

3
Beginning with Python 3.4, venv (a stdlib alternative to
virtualenv) will create virtualenv environments with pip
pre-installed, thereby making it an equal alternative to
virtualenv.

4
The compatible release specifier was accepted in PEP 440
and support was released in setuptools v8.0 and
pip v6.0
