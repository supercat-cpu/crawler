“GitHub is the world’s mono repository, so sharing our open source there is natural.”
              
— Martin Andersen, VP of Engineering, Trustpilot

  Read the case study 




“GitHub Advanced Security is there for every pull request and excels compared to other static analysis tools we have used.”
              
— Dimosthenis Kaponis, CTO, Netdata

  Read the case study 




“GitHub keeps us up to speed with the industry’s best tools. We want new hires to know GitHub is in our toolchain—it makes them excited to join us.”
              
— Spencer Kaiser, Principal Architect of Emerging Tech, American Airlines

  Read the case study 




“This collaborative way of building software is unstoppable. It isn’t going away—and GitHub has its place in that. We can make the whole company rethink how they build software.”
              
— Ingo Sauerzapf, SAP Cloud Development Tools Manager

  Read the case study 




“People know what a pull request is because it’s how they contribute to open source projects. We have many developers who are well-versed with GitHub, either for personal development or previous roles. With GitHub Enterprise, no one has to relearn the wheel.”
              
— Laurent Ploix, Product Manager, Spotify

  Read the case study 




“I have seen some truly revolutionary actions happen in communities on GitHub. People are collaborating on code but they’re also having foundational conversations on best practices and how software, as a whole, is built. More and more, GitHub is an internet archive. It’s a deeply social and critical piece of our infrastructure.”
              
— Michael Glukhovsky, Developer, Stripe

  Read the case study 




“When we started talking about code reuse, we felt like we already had the perfect platform in place: GitHub.”
              
— Timothy Carmean, Software Processes and Tools Supervisor, Ford

  Read the case study 




“Using GitHub Enterprise Cloud removes the burden of managing infrastructure, and we don’t need to worry about the availability of our versioning code, source code and versioning tools. It lets us focus on what’s important for our business, and that’s our customers.”
              
— Victor Gomes, Infosec Tech Manager, Nubank
